What sorts of things would you like to do or accomplish in Waterloo Engineering and why?

Currently, I am reading *Clean Code* and learning to reconstruct my code. After reading the book, I realized that it is far not enough simply making the code running. It need to be well constructed. Each class, each function need to be well defined and written for good understanding, future development and to avoid possible mistakes. I haven't learned about Object Oriented Programming systematically. I didn't know about Single Responsibility Principle, Open Closed Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle, etc. I didn't know about the differences between strongly/weakly typed language and dynamic/static typed language. In general, what I want from waterloo is a systematic education in programming. I want to learn about the principles, the basics, and how everything works behind the scenes. I believe it is better to know the principles than to remember traits.

Also, I want to earn hands-on experiences from waterloo. Waterloo's co-op program

What sorts of things would you like to do or accomplish in Waterloo Engineering and why?

Currently, I am reading Clean Code and learning to reconstruct my code. I realize that it is far from enough to simply make the code run. It need to be well constructed. Each class and function must be well defined and written for clarity, future development and to prevent errors. I haven't learned Object Oriented Programming systematically. The Single Responsibility Principle, Open Closed Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle and other concepts are unfamiliar to me. I don't know the differences between strongly/weakly typed language and dynamic/static typed language. I hope to learn programming systematically at Waterloo. Iâ€™m interested in the principles, the basics, and how everything works behind the scenes. 

In addition, I want to earn hands-on experiences from Waterloo's co-op program, where I will gain two years of work experience. It will make me more competitive in job market.

Building has always been appealing to me. As a child, I liked playing with LEGO. As I got older, I developed a hobby for woodworking, although I was constrained by a lack of tools. However, this issue was resolved when I subsequently began studying competitive programming. A computer and an internet connection are all I require. Although CP focuses primarily on algorithms and problem-solving, I also spent my free time researching fascinating projects online like CYaRon, cf-tool, LaTeX, etc. After I retired from competitive programming, I started developing. I played with Linux server and self-deployed several services such as TTRSS, BitWarden, Huginn, etc. I learned JavaScript and TypeScript and wrote a plugin for the note-taking app Obsidian, which is developed by two Waterloo graduates. I also learned to use Vitest for test driven development and esbuild for rollup.

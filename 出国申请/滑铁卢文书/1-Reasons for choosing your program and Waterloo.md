## Why Waterloo

I appreciate the co-op programme of Waterloo and loved its atmosphere. Also, waterloo's computer related majors are compelling for me.

## Computer Science and Business Administration Double degree

I have some experiences in Competitive Programming, so Computer Science would be suitable for me. In the future, I plan to switch from pure technique jobs to manager jobs with technique requirements, so Business Administration would be useful.

## Software Programming

I have no real large software developing experience, but I have written a plugin for the note-taking app Obsidian using Typescript along with ESBuild for rolling up source codes and Vitest for Test Driven Development, which I have learned from the book Clean Code but is still getting familiar with.

## Mathematics

I have always been interested in Mathematics, though less interested than programming.

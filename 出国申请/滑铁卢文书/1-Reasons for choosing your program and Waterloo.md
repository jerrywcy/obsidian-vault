Why Waterloo?

I like the atmosphere and the co-op program at Waterloo. What appeals to me most is the computer-related programs here.

CS and BBA Double degree

I am interested in computer science and have experiences in competitive programming. This program integrates computer science with business administration, which will increase my competitiveness as I pursue a managerial position in a computer technology company. 

Software Programming

Although I don't have much experience developing large-scale software, I did use Typescript to create a plugin for the note-taking app Obsidian, along with ESBuild for compiling source code and Vitest for Test Driven Development, which I learned about from the book Clean Code but am still getting familiar with.

Mathematics

I have always been interested in Mathematics, which is the foundation of computer science, or to be more specific, algorithms.

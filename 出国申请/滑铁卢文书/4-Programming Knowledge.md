If you have applied to Software Engineering you are required to demonstrate that you have experience in developing well-structured, modular programs. However, all applicants should list their programming experience if applicable. 

For every programming language in which you have at least four months of programming experience, list the language, number of months experience you have in using the language (not how long you have known it), and capacity in which you used the language (e.g., courses completed, work experience, self education).

C++: The language that I have been using since 2016. I mainly use it in competitive programming, so I don't know much about its grammar and libraries, only those enough for basic IO and algorithms.

Java: Limited to AP Computer Science A subset. Learned in 2021. Haven't used it to write a program at all, but know all of its basic features.

Python: Taught in school but learned much more than school by myself. Learned in 2018 and have been using it from time to time. No software developed, but have written some scripts for productive use.

JavaScript and TypeScript: Learned in 2022.7 and have been using since then. I have written a plugin for the note-taking app Obsidian using TypeScript. Source Code here: https://github.com/jerrywcy/obsidian-path-finder Know pretty much about its feature and grammars and know how to use regex and promises.

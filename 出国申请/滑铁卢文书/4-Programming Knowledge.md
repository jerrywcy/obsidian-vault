If you have applied to Software Engineering you are required to demonstrate that you have experience in developing well-structured, modular programs. However, all applicants should list their programming experience if applicable. 

For every programming language in which you have at least four months of programming experience, list the language, number of months experience you have in using the language (not how long you have known it), and capacity in which you used the language (e.g., courses completed, work experience, self education).

C++: Used since 2016, mainly in competitive programming. I don't know much about its grammar and libraries, only those for basic IO and algorithms.

Java: Learned in 2021, its basic features mastered. Not used to write any program.

Python: Learned in 2018 and used occasionally. No software developed, but some scripts written for productive use.

JavaScript and TypeScript: Learned in July 2022 and used since then. Wrote a plugin for the note-taking app Obsidian using TypeScript (https://github.com/jerrywcy/obsidian-path-finder) I know well its features and grammars and how to use regex and promises.

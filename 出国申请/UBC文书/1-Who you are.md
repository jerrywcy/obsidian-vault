Most people have the impression that I like learning new things and honing my skills.

I began competitive programming in 5th grade and have learnt various algorithms, such as greedy, dynamic programming, graph theory algorithms (including Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Tarjan), and Data Structures (including monotone queue, segment tree, chunking algorithm, heavy path decomposition).

I quit competitive programming in 11th grade; yet my learning never stopped. I built my blog using Hexo, and my password manager using BitWarden. I learned how to use GitHub, Git, and Vim. I played with Linux and explored commands.

An experience that I am proud of was developing an Obsidian plugin, a process with challenges. Learning TypeScript and JavaScript was the first step. I spent a week reading tutorials and quickly skimming the documentation before I began to code. Then, with a poorly defined API reference file and scant documentation, I managed to figure out how to use the Obsidian API by reading the codes of well-written plugins and consulting experienced developers. What came next was an algorithm for path-finding. I applied Yen's algorithm as a variation of the k-shortest path algorithm. Finally, I selected D3.js as a data visualization tool to draw a force graph and spent three days learning how to use it.

Even though I ran into obstacles, the developing process was enjoyable. While reading manuals, coding, or coming up with novel solutions to a problem, I was completely engrossed and excited.

## Highlights
* To use the Zettelkasten method you write three different types of notes; fleeting, permanent, and project. Permanent notes are stored long-term in two different places, a reference system, and a slip-box.
	* 1. Writing is The Only Thing that Matters: Thinking through the medium of writing will improve your reading, thinking, and other intellectual skills. And so this principle implies you must consume information with the purpose of writing about it.
	* 2. Simplicity is Paramount: To be successful, the system must reduce the number of decisions made by standardized note-taking, having a clear separation between the different types of notes, and designated storage for each type.
	* 3. Nobody Ever Starts from Scratch: The system must build trust by surfacing insight, connecting different lines of thought, and improving oneâ€™s thinking. As itâ€™s used, thinking and writing should become easier and more valuable.
	* 4. Let the Work Carry You Forward: It must have a workflow that generates its own momentum through positive experiences and at the same time improve the learning process.
* Fleeting Note ðŸŸ© - Used for capturing ideas quickly. They serve as mere reminders of information and can be written in a variety of ways. Taking them should not distract you from your work.
* Permanent Note ðŸŸ¥ - Used to capture ideas from text (literature note) or used to elaborate on and create an atomic note (permanent slip-box note). Permanent means they are kept forever.
* Project Note ðŸŸ¨ - Used to capture information pertaining to a particular project. Kept together in a project-specific folder and are archived or discarded when the project is finished.
* Throughout the day capture your fleeting notes in your daily note. Fleeting notes are mere reminders of information and can be written in a variety of ways.
* Literature notes are meant to abstract interesting ideas. Theyâ€™re how youâ€™ll remember what you've read, watched, or listened to long enough to expand on it. Writing literature notes is a catalyst for your own intellectual development with the side-effect of being the beginning of your external knowledge base.
* Once-daily (ideally), go through your fleeting and literature notes and translate them into permanent notes, using the following process: 1. Identify whatâ€™s relevant to your own research, interest, or thinking 2. Elaborate on the idea until itâ€™s understood without its prior context 3. Connect (link) it to existing permanent notes in the slip-box

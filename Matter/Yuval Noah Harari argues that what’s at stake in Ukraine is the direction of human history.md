## Highlights
* During the same period, the global economy has been transformed from one based on materials to one based on knowledge. Where once the main sources of wealth were material assets such as gold mines, wheat fields and oil wells, today the main source of wealth is knowledge. And whereas you can seize oil fields by force, you cannot acquire knowledge that way. The profitability of conquest has declined as a result.
* For most of history peace meant only “the temporary absence of war”.
* In recent decades “peace” has come to mean “the implausibility of war”.

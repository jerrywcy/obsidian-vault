The graphs illustrates the procedure of producing cement and concrete.
The first step of making cement is to crush limestone and clay into powder and mix them together using a mixer. Then the powder goes through an inclining rotating heater, where the powder gets heated from down to up while being rotated. After being ground in a grinder, the powder becomes cement, which can later be used in the production of concrete, and are packed in bags for sale.
Compared with cement, the production of concrete is much simpler. The whole procedure is of mixing together various materials in different proportion. After mixing together 10% of water, 15% of cement, which is produced, 25% sand and 50% of gravel, which are small stones, together in a concrete mixer, concrete is made.
In general, the production of cement is more complex, which involves going through a mixer, a rotating heater and a grinder, while that of concrete is relatively easier.

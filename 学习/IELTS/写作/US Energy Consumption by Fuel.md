The line chart illustrates the change of power consumption in terms of fuel from 1980 with predictions until 2030.
Petrol and oil took up 35 quadrillion units of U.S. energy consumption in 1980. After a few years of fluctuation, it kept a steady upward trend from 1995 to 2005 then slowed down its pace during 2005 to 2020. This trend is expected to continue in the next 10 years.
As for the figure for coal and natural, they both followed a similar pattern of fluctuation starting at roughly 20 quadrillion units in 1980 and kept a rising trend through out the years. However, the consumption of coal is predicted to keep rising in the next decade while usage of natural gas will stay constant. 
Similarly, the consumption of nuclear, solar or wind and hydropower shared the same pattern of staying generally constant at a level of about 5 quadrillion units. 
In general, with time goes by, all sorts of energy consumption has been rising since 1980 and is predicted to rise in the future except for hydropower.

The graph illustrates the sales of four types of digital games worldwide, including mobile phone games, online games, console games, and handheld games.
Handheld games have always been at the top and leaving others far behind. In 2000, the sales for handheld games were about $12bn, which kept a steady upwards trend throughout the years to about $18bn in 2006. On contrary, the figure for console games, though starting at $6bn in 2000, dropped slowly but steadily during the 6 year period to only roughly $3bn in 2006.
In comparison, although neither of mobile phone games can be seen on the market in 2000, both of them managed to maintain a rapid growth throughout the years. Online games started up in market in 2001 and reached approximately $9bn in 2006, while mobile phone games started in 2002, achieving $7bn at last.
In general, with handheld games always ranking the top and console games gradually out of fashion, online games and handheld games have been chasing up and are showing a promising future.

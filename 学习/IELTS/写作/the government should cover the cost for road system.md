Some argue that the government should cover the cost for road system instead of making passengers pay for it. Although the policy of making passengers pay for road costs can alleviate government's financial stress, this is in fact a short-sighted decision. With the government covering the cost for road system, the transportation cost, which plays a crucial role in various industries, will be greatly reduced, thus leading to better development of economics.

The graph illustrates destination of UK graduates and postgraduates other than full-time work in 2008.
Further study was the destination for 29665 graduates, comprising a biggest part of all graduates, followed by part-time work and unemployment, which are destination of 17735 and 16235 graduates respectively. In comparison, only 3500 graduates chose voluntary work. 
As for postgraduates, situation was similar. 2725 students went on to pursue further study, while 2535 postgraduates left university and did part-time work. 1625 postgraduates ended up unemployed, whereas merely 345 students took up voluntary work.
The destination of UK graduates and postgraduates showed similar pattern. Further study was undoubtedly the destination chose by most people, followed by part-time work and unemployment, while voluntary work was always at the bottom. It is worth noticing that, voluntary work was often a far less popular choice of destination for students, no matter graduates or postgraduates.

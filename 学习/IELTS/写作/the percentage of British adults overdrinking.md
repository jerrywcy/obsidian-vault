The bar chart illustrates the proportion of British adults who drink more than the recommended guideline at least once a week in 2004, while the line chart presents the consumption of alcohol of children in England on the average each year between 1990 and 2004.
Among all age groups, people aged 25 to 44 has the strongest tendency to exceed the recommended guideline, whilst the elderly aged more than 65 tend to follow the guideline best. There is also a shared feature among the age group: men tend to drink more alcohol than women.
This phenomenon is also observed in children whose age is between 11 and 15. The average alcohol consumption of boys started at near 6 units in 1990, then after 10 years of rising and peaking 12 units in 2000, kept a slow downwards trend from then on. In comparison, the figure for girls, though stayed constant at near 5 units for the first two years, went straight up in the following years to over 10 units in 2004.
It can be clearly seen that alcohol consumption for children tend to increase as time goes by, while a certain age group of person seem to consume alcohol most. Also, men drink more alcohol than women in general.

Environmental protection, as known to all, is an vital problem both nationally and across the world. Countless conferences have been hold, numerous documents have been issued just to address this problem. However, in sharp contrast, few actually make effort to change the situation. 
Under such a contradiction are some real reasons. First of all, admittedly, people are, in fact, clearly aware of the existence and possible consequences of the environmental problem. However, many still posses the limited opinion that the problem is already to a extent at which individual efforts are useless and the only way to address the problem is nationally or even internationally cooperation and projects, such as prompting usage of electric cars national-wide and such projects require huge amounts of money and resources, which cannot be done on individual level, thus doing nothing practical to help protect the environment. The second reason is that people are generally reluctant to react to something that happens after a long time, even if it can lead to serious consequences. The longest time period that most people can make plan for is one year, let along the disasters that happens decades later. Most people are confined to their current life and is short-sighted and indifference towards environmental conservation. Only when the disaster is about to fall on them will people pay efforts to address it. The two points together lead to the contradiction.
As for actions that individuals can take to protect the environment, there are quite a lot. Taking public transport if possible, buy products made from recycled materials, use weaved bags instead of plastic bags, to name but a few.

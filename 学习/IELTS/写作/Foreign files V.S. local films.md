Many people prefer to watch foreign films rather than locally produced films. Why could this be? Should governments give more financial support to local industries?

There are many reasons why people prefer foreign films over locally produced films. First, locally produced films often fail to compete with foreign films in visual impact on audiences. For most countries, their filming industry is underdeveloped with neither enough money to buy movie props expensive enough to create massive visual impact nor techniques advanced enough to produce special effects to compete with foreign films, especially those from Hollywood. Second, foreign films can provide viewers with novelty. When watching foreign movies, audiences may experience foreign folklore, foreign people, foreign government, to sum up, a brand new experience. Local films, on the other hand, mainly consist of familiar elements for the audiences, thus unable to provide such novelty. Considering all these deficiencies, it is no doubt that foreign films appeal to more audiences than local films do.
To change the situation, the government should provide financial support to local filming industries.P With governmental investment into the industry, expensive movie props could be purchased and high-level techniques in producing visual effects may be introduced, not to mention famous film stars, better directors, etc.

## 1997 AIME Problem 1

How many of the integers between 1 and 1000, inclusive, can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers?
Solution

If we let the two squares be $a^2 - b^2 = x$, then by difference of squares we have $(a-b)(a+b) = x$. Notice that $a-b$ and $a+b$ have the same parities. This eliminates all numbers in the form of $4n+2$: when $x=2(2n+1)$ is factored, one of the factors must be even, but not both, so its factors cannot have the same parity.

The remaining $\boxed{750}$ numbers, we can describe specific squares which fit the conditions:

For all odd $x = 2n+1$, $(n+1)^2 - (n^2) = x$.
For all $x = 4n$, $(n+1)^2 - (n-1)^2 = x$.



## 1997 AIME Problem 2

The nine horizontal and nine vertical lines on an $8\times8$ checkerboard form $r$ rectangles, of which $s$ are squares. The number $s/r$ can be written in the form $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n.$
Solution

To determine the two horizontal sides of a rectangle, we have to pick two of the horizontal lines of the checkerboard, or ${9\choose 2} = 36$. Similarily, there are ${9\choose 2}$ ways to pick the vertical sides, giving us $r = 1296$ rectangles.

For $s$, there are $8^2$ unit squares, $7^2$ of the $2\times2$ squares, and so on until $1^2$ of the $8\times 8$ squares. Using the sum of squares formula, that gives us $s=1^2+2^2+\cdots+8^2=\frac{(8)(8+1)(2\cdot8+1)}{6}=12*17=204$.

Thus $\frac sr = \frac{204}{1296}=\frac{17}{108}$, and $m+n=\boxed{125}$.


## 1997 AIME Problem 3


Sarah intended to multiply a two-digit number and a three-digit number, but she left out the multiplication sign and simply placed the two-digit number to the left of the three-digit number, thereby forming a five-digit number. This number is exactly nine times the product Sarah should have obtained. What is the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number?
Solution

Let $x$ be the two-digit number, $y$ be the three-digit number. Putting together the given, we have $1000x+y=9xy \Longrightarrow 9xy-1000x-y=0$. Using SFFT, this factorizes to $(9x-1)\left(y-\frac{1000}{9}\right)=\frac{1000}{9}$, and $(9x-1)(9y-1000)=1000$.

Since $89 < 9x-1 < 890$, we can use trial and error on factors of 1000. If $9x - 1 = 100$, we get a non-integer. If $9x - 1 = 125$, we get $x=14$ and $y=112$, which satisifies the conditions. Hence the answer is $112 + 14 = \boxed{126}$.
Solution 2

As shown above, we have $1000x+y=9xy$, so $1000/y=9-1/x$. $1000/y$ must be just a little bit smaller than 9, so we find $y=112$, $x=14$, and the solution is $\boxed{126}$.


## 1997 AIME Problem 4

Circles of radii $5, 5, 8,$ and $\frac mn$ are mutually externally tangent, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n.$
Solution

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/0/00/1997_AIME-4.png" height="200px" /></div>

If (in the diagram above) we draw the line going through the centers of the circles with radii $8$ and $\frac mn = r$, that line is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the centers of the two circles with radii $5$. Then we form two right triangles, of lengths $5, x, 5+r$ and $5, 8+r+x, 13$, wher $x$ is the distance between the center of the circle in question and the segment connecting the centers of the two circles of radii $5$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, we now have two equations with two unknowns:

$\begin{eqnarray*} 5^2 + x^2 &=& (5+r)^2 \\ x &=& \sqrt{10r + r^2} \\ && \\ (8 + r + \sqrt{10r+r^2})^2 + 5^2 &=& 13^2\\ 8 + r + \sqrt{10r+r^2} &=& 12\\ \sqrt{10r+r^2}&=& 4-r\\ 10r+r^2 &=& 16 - 8r + r^2\\ r &=& \frac{8}{9} \end{eqnarray*}$

So $m+n = \boxed{17}$.


NOTE: It can be seen that there is no apparent need to use the variable x as a 5,12,13 right triangle has been formed.


## 1997 AIME Problem 5

The number $r$ can be expressed as a four-place decimal $0.abcd,$ where $a, b, c,$ and $d$ represent digits, any of which could be zero. It is desired to approximate $r$ by a fraction whose numerator is 1 or 2 and whose denominator is an integer. The closest such fraction to $r$ is $\frac 27.$ What is the number of possible values for $r$?
Solution

The nearest fractions to $\frac 27$ with numerator $1$ are $\frac 13, \frac 14$; and with numerator $2$ are $\frac 26, \frac 28 = \frac 13, \frac 14$ anyway. For $\frac 27$ to be the best approximation for $r$, the decimal must be closer to $\frac 27 \approx .28571$ than to $\frac 13 \approx .33333$ or $\frac 14 \approx .25$.

Thus $r$ can range between $\frac{\frac 14 + \frac{2}{7}}{2} \approx .267857$ and $\frac{\frac 13 + \frac{2}{7}}{2} \approx .309523$. At $r = .2679, .3095$, it becomes closer to the other fractions, so $.2679 \le r \le .3095$ and the number of values of $r$ is $3095 - 2679 + 1 = \boxed{417}$.


## 1997 AIME Problem 6


Point $B$ is in the exterior of the regular $n$-sided polygon $A_1A_2\cdots A_n$, and $A_1A_2B$ is an equilateral triangle. What is the largest value of $n$ for which $A_1$, $A_n$, and $B$ are consecutive vertices of a regular polygon?
Solution 1

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/3/32/1997_AIME-6.png" height="200px" /></div>

Let the other regular polygon have $m$ sides. Using the interior angle of a regular polygon formula, we have $\angle A_2A_1A_n = \frac{(n-2)180}{n}$, $\angle A_nA_1B = \frac{(m-2)180}{m}$, and $\angle A_2A_1B = 60^{\circ}$. Since those three angles add up to $360^{\circ}$,

$\begin{eqnarray*} \frac{(n-2)180}{n} + \frac{(m-2)180}{m} &=& 300\\ m(n-2)180 + n(m-2)180 &=& 300mn\\ 360mn - 360m - 360n &=& 300mn\\ mn - 6m - 6n &=& 0 \end{eqnarray*}$ 

Using SFFT,

$\begin{eqnarray*} (m-6)(n-6) &=& 36 \end{eqnarray*}$ Clearly $n$ is maximized when $m = 7, n = \boxed{42}$.
Solution 2

As above, find that $mn - 6m - 6n = 0$ using the formula for the interior angle of a polygon.

Solve for $n$ to find that $n = \frac{6m}{m-6}$. Clearly, $m>6$ for $n$ to be positive.

With this restriction of $m>6$, the larger $m$ gets, the smaller the fraction $\frac{6m}{m-6}$ becomes. This can be proven either by calculus, by noting that $n = \frac{6m}{m-6}$ is a transformed hyperbola, or by dividing out the rational function to get $n = 6 + \frac{36}{m - 6}.$

Either way, minimizng $m$ will maximize $n$, and the smallest integer $m$ such that $n$ is positive is $m=7$, giving $n = \boxed{42}$
Solution 3

From the formula for the measure for an individual angle of a regular n-gon, $180 - \frac{360}{n}$, the measure of $\angle A_2A_1A_n = 180 - \frac{360}{n}$. Together with the fact that an equilateral triangle has angles measuring 60 degrees, the measure of $\angle A_nA_1B = 120 + \frac{360}{n}$ (Notice that this value decreases as $n$ increases; hence, we are looking for the least possible value of $\angle A_nA_1B$). For $A_n, A_1, B$ to be vertices of a regular polygon, $\angle A_nA_1B$ must be of the form $180 - \frac{360}{n}$, where $n$ is a natural number greater than or equal to 3. It is obvious that $\angle A_nA_1B > 120$. The least angle satisfying this condition is $180 - \frac{360}{7}$. Equating this with $120 + \frac{360}{n}$ and solving yields $n = \boxed{42}$


## 1997 AIME Problem 7

A car travels due east at $\frac 23$ mile per minute on a long, straight road. At the same time, a circular storm, whose radius is $51$ miles, moves southeast at $\frac 12\sqrt{2}$ mile per minute. At time $t=0$, the center of the storm is $110$ miles due north of the car. At time $t=t_1$ minutes, the car enters the storm circle, and at time $t=t_2$ minutes, the car leaves the storm circle. Find $\frac 12(t_1+t_2)$.
Solution

We set up a coordinate system, with the starting point of the car at the origin. At time $t$, the car is at $\left(\frac 23t,0\right)$ and the center of the storm is at $\left(\frac{t}{2}, 110 - \frac{t}{2}\right)$. Using the distance formula,

$\begin{eqnarray*} \sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{3}t - \frac 12t\right)^2 + \left(110-\frac{t}{2}\right)^2} &\le& 51\\ \frac{t^2}{36} + \frac{t^2}{4} - 110t + 110^2 &\le& 51^2\\ \frac{5}{18}t^2 - 110t + 110^2 - 51^2 &\le& 0\\ \end{eqnarray*}$

Noting that $\frac 12(t_1+t_2)$ is at the maximum point of the parabola, we can use $-\frac{b}{2a} = \frac{110}{2 \cdot \frac{5}{18}} = \boxed{198}$.


## 1997 AIME Problem 8

How many different $4\times 4$ arrays whose entries are all 1's and -1's have the property that the sum of the entries in each row is 0 and the sum of the entries in each column is 0?

Solution
Solution 1

For more detailed explanations, see related problem (AIME I 2007, 10).

The problem is asking us for all configurations of $4\times 4$ grids with 2 1's and 2 -1's in each row and column. We do casework upon the first two columns:

The first two columns share no two numbers in the same row. There are ${4\choose2} = 6$ ways to pick two 1's in the first column, and the second column is determined. For the third and fourth columns, no two numbers can be in the same row (to make the sum of each row 0), so again there are ${4\choose 2}$ ways. This gives $6^2 = 36$.
The first two columns share one number in the same row. There are ${4\choose 1} = 4$ ways to pick the position of the shared 1, then ${3\choose 2} = 3$ ways to pick the locations for the next two 1s, and then $2$ ways to orient the 1s. For the third and fourth columns, the two rows with shared 1s or -1s are fixed, so the only things that can be changed is the orientation of the mixed rows, in $2$ ways. This gives $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 48$.
The first two columns share two numbers in th same row. There are ${4\choose 2} = 6$ ways to pick the position of the shared 1s. Everything is then fixed.

Adding these cases up, we get $36 + 48 + 6 = \boxed{90}$.


## 1997 AIME Problem 9


Given a nonnegative real number $x$, let $\langle x\rangle$ denote the fractional part of $x$; that is, $\langle x\rangle=x-\lfloor x\rfloor$, where $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. Suppose that $a$ is positive, $\langle a^{-1}\rangle=\langle a^2\rangle$, and $2<a^2<3$. Find the value of $a^{12}-144a^{-1}$.
Solution 1

Looking at the properties of the number, it is immediately guess-able that $a = \phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}2$ (the golden ratio) is the answer. The following is the way to derive that:

Since $\sqrt{2} < a < \sqrt{3}$, $0 < \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} < a^{-1} < \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} < 1$. Thus $\langle a^2 \rangle = a^{-1}$, and it follows that $a^2 - 2 = a^{-1} \Longrightarrow a^3 - 2a - 1 = 0$. Noting that $-1$ is a root, this factors to $(a+1)(a^2 - a - 1) = 0$, so $a = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$ (we discard the negative root).

Our answer is $(a^2)^{6}-144a^{-1} = \left(\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}2\right)^6 - 144\left(\frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{5}}\right)$. Complex conjugates reduce the second term to $-72(\sqrt{5}-1)$. The first term we can expand by the binomial theorem to get $\frac 1{2^6}\left(3^6 + 6\cdot 3^5\sqrt{5} + 15\cdot 3^4 \cdot 5 + 20\cdot 3^3 \cdot 5\sqrt{5} + 15 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 25 + 6 \cdot 3 \cdot 25\sqrt{5} + 5^3\right)$ $= \frac{1}{64}\left(10304 + 4608\sqrt{5}\right) = 161 + 72\sqrt{5}$. The answer is $161 + 72\sqrt{5} - 72\sqrt{5} + 72 = \boxed{233}$.

Note that to determine our answer, we could have also used other properties of $\phi$ like $\phi^3 = 2\phi + 1$.
Solution 2

Find $a$ as shown above. Note that, since $a$ is a root of the equation $a^3 - 2a - 1 = 0$, $a^3 = 2a + 1$, and $a^{12} = (2a + 1)^4$. Also note that, since $a$ is a root of $a^2 - a - 1 = 0$, $\frac{1}{a} = a - 1$. The expression we wish to calculate then becomes $(2a + 1)^4 - 144(a - 1)$. Plugging in $a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$, we plug in to get an answer of $(161 + 72\sqrt{5}) + 72 - 72\sqrt{5} = 161 + 72 = \boxed{233}$.
Solution 3

Find $a$ as shown above. Note that $a$ satisfies the equation $a^2 = a+1$ (this is the equation we solved to get it). Then, we can simplify $a^{12}$ as follows using the fibonacci numbers:

$a^{12} = a^{11}+a^{10}= 2a^{10} + a^{9} = 3a^8+ 2a^9 = ... = 144a^1+89a^0 = 144a+89$

So we want $144(a-\frac1a)+89 = 144(1)+89 = \boxed{233}$ since $a-\frac1a = 1$ is equivalent to $a^2 = a+1$.


## 1997 AIME Problem 10

Every card in a deck has a picture of one shape - circle, square, or triangle, which is painted in one of the three colors - red, blue, or green. Furthermore, each color is applied in one of three shades - light, medium, or dark. The deck has 27 cards, with every shape-color-shade combination represented. A set of three cards from the deck is called complementary if all of the following statements are true:

i. Either each of the three cards has a different shape or all three of the card have the same shape.

ii. Either each of the three cards has a different color or all three of the cards have the same color.

iii. Either each of the three cards has a different shade or all three of the cards have the same shade.

How many different complementary three-card sets are there?

Solution
Solution 1

$\begin{eqnarray*} x &=& \frac {\sum_{n = 1}^{44} \cos n^\circ}{\sum_{n = 1}^{44} \sin n^\circ} = \frac {\cos 1 + \cos 2 + \dots + \cos 44}{\sin 1 + \sin 2 + \dots + \sin 44}\\ &=& \frac {\cos (45 - 1) + \cos(45 - 2) + \dots + \cos(45 - 44)}{\sin 1 + \sin 2 + \dots + \sin 44} \end{eqnarray*}$

Using the identity $\sin a + \sin b = 2\sin \frac{a+b}2 \cos \frac{a-b}{2}$ $\Longrightarrow \sin x + \cos x$ $= \sin x + \sin (90-x)$ $= 2 \sin 45 \cos (45-x)$ $= \sqrt{2} \cos (45-x)$, that summation reduces to

$\begin{eqnarray*}x &=& \left(\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}\right)\left(\frac {(\cos 1 + \cos2 + \dots + \cos44) + (\sin1 + \sin2 + \dots + \sin44)}{\sin1 + \sin2 + \dots + \sin44}\right)\\ &=& \left(\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}\right)\left(1 + \frac {\cos 1 + \cos 2 + \dots + \cos 44}{\sin 1 + \sin 2 + \dots + \sin 44}\right) \end{eqnarray*}$

This fraction is equivalent to $x$. Therefore, 

$\begin{eqnarray*} x &=& \left(\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}\right)\left(1 + x\right)\\ \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}} &=& x\left(\frac {\sqrt {2} - 1}{\sqrt {2}}\right)\\ x &=& \frac {1}{\sqrt {2} - 1} = 1 + \sqrt {2}\\ \lfloor 100x \rfloor &=& \lfloor 100(1 + \sqrt {2}) \rfloor = \boxed{241}\\ \end{eqnarray*}$

Solution 2

A slight variant of the above solution, note that

$\begin{eqnarray*} \sum_{n=1}^{44} \cos n + \sum_{n=1}^{44} \sin n &=& \sum_{n=1}^{44} \sin n + \sin(90-n)\\ &=& \sqrt{2}\sum_{n=1}^{44} \cos(45-n) = \sqrt{2}\sum_{n=1}^{44} \cos n\\ \sum_{n=1}^{44} \sin n &=& (\sqrt{2}-1)\sum_{n=1}^{44} \cos n \end{eqnarray*}$

This is the ratio we are looking for. $x$ reduces to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2} - 1} = \sqrt{2} + 1$, and $\lfloor 100(\sqrt{2} + 1)\rfloor = \boxed{241}$.
Solution 3

Consider the sum $\sum_{n = 1}^{44} \text{cis } n^\circ$. The fraction is given by the real part divided by the imaginary part.

The sum can be written $- 1 + \sum_{n = 0}^{44} \text{cis } n^\circ = - 1 + \frac {\text{cis } 45^\circ - 1}{\text{cis } 1^\circ - 1}$ (by De Moivre's Theorem with geometric series)

$= - 1 + \frac {\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2} - 1 + \frac {i \sqrt {2}}{2}}{\text{cis } 1^\circ - 1} = - 1 + \frac {\left( \frac {\sqrt {2}}{2} - 1 + \frac {i \sqrt {2}}{2} \right) (\text{cis } ( - 1^\circ) - 1)}{(\cos 1^\circ - 1)^2 + \sin^2 1^\circ}$ (after multiplying by complex conjugate)

$= - 1 + \frac {\left( \frac {\sqrt {2}}{2} - 1 \right) (\cos 1^\circ - 1) + \frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}\sin 1^\circ + i\left( \left(1 - \frac {\sqrt {2}}{2} \right) \sin 1^\circ + \frac {\sqrt {2}}{2} (\cos 1^\circ - 1)\right)}{2(1 - \cos 1^\circ)}$

$= - \frac {1}{2} - \frac {\sqrt {2}}{4} - \frac {i\sqrt {2}}{4} + \frac {\sin 1^\circ \left( \frac {\sqrt {2}}{2} + i\left( 1 - \frac {\sqrt {2}}{2} \right) \right)}{2(1 - \cos 1^\circ)}$

Using the tangent half-angle formula, this becomes $\left( - \frac {1}{2} + \frac {\sqrt {2}}{4}[\cot (1/2^\circ) - 1] \right) + i\left( \frac {1}{2}\cot (1/2^\circ) - \frac {\sqrt {2}}{4}[\cot (1/2^\circ) + 1] \right)$.

Dividing the two parts and multiplying each part by 4, the fraction is $\frac { - 2 + \sqrt {2}[\cot (1/2^\circ) - 1]}{2\cot (1/2^\circ) - \sqrt {2}[\cot (1/2^\circ) + 1]}$.

Although an exact value for $\cot (1/2^\circ)$ in terms of radicals will be difficult, this is easily known: it is really large!

So treat it as though it were $\infty$. The fraction is approximated by $\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2 - \sqrt {2}} = \frac {\sqrt {2}(2 + \sqrt {2})}{2} = 1 + \sqrt {2}\Rightarrow \lfloor 100(1+\sqrt2)\rfloor=\boxed{241}$.


## 1997 AIME Problem 12

The function $f$ defined by $f(x)= \frac{ax+b}{cx+d}$, where $a$,$b$,$c$ and $d$ are nonzero real numbers, has the properties $f(19)=19$, $f(97)=97$ and $f(f(x))=x$ for all values except $\frac{-d}{c}$. Find the unique number that is not in the range of $f$.

Solution
Solution 1

First, we use the fact that $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain. Substituting the function definition, we have $\frac {a\frac {ax + b}{cx + d} + b}{c\frac {ax + b}{cx + d} + d} = x$, which reduces to $\frac {(a^2 + bc)x + b(a + d)}{c(a + d)x + (bc + d^2)} =\frac {px + q}{rx + s} = x.$ In order for this fraction to reduce to $x$, we must have $q = r = 0$ and $p = s\not = 0$. From $c(a + d) = b(a + d) = 0$, we get $a = - d$ or $b = c = 0$. The second cannot be true, since we are given that $a,b,c,d$ are nonzero. This means $a = - d$, so $f(x) = \frac {ax + b}{cx - a}$.

The only value that is not in the range of this function is $\frac {a}{c}$. To find $\frac {a}{c}$, we use the two values of the function given to us. We get $2(97)a + b = 97^2c$ and $2(19)a + b = 19^2c$. Subtracting the second equation from the first will eliminate $b$, and this results in $2(97 - 19)a = (97^2 - 19^2)c$, so $\frac {a}{c} = \frac {(97 - 19)(97 + 19)}{2(97 - 19)} = 58 .$

Alternatively, we could have found out that $a = -d$ by using the fact that $f(f(-b/a))=-b/a$.
Solution 2

First, we note that $e = \frac ac$ is the horizontal asymptote of the function, and since this is a linear function over a linear function, the unique number not in the range of $f$ will be $e$. $\frac{ax+b}{cx+d} = \frac{b-\frac{cd}{a}}{cx+d} + \frac{a}{c}$. Without loss of generality, let $c=1$, so the function becomes $\frac{b- \frac{d}{a}}{x+d} + e$.

(Considering $\infty$ as a limit) By the given, $f(f(\infty)) = \infty$. $\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x) = e$, so $f(e) = \infty$. $f(x) \rightarrow \infty$ as $x$ reaches the vertical asymptote, which is at $-\frac{d}{c} = -d$. Hence $e = -d$. Substituting the givens, we get

$\begin{align*} 19 &= \frac{b - \frac da}{19 - e} + e\\ 97 &= \frac{b - \frac da}{97 - e} + e\\ b - \frac da &= (19 - e)^2 = (97 - e)^2\\ 19 - e &= \pm (97 - e) \end{align*}$

Clearly we can discard the positive root, so $e = 58$.
Solution 3

We first note (as before) that the number not in the range of $f(x) = \frac{ax+b}{cx+ d} = \frac{a}{c} + \frac{b - ad/c}{cx+d}$ is $a/c$, as $\frac{b-ad/c}{cx+d}$ is evidently never 0 (otherwise, $f$ would be a constant function, violating the condition $f(19) \neq f(97)$).

We may represent the real number $x/y$ as $$\begin{pmatrix}x \\ y\end{pmatrix}$$, with two such column vectors considered equivalent if they are scalar multiples of each other. Similarly, we can represent a function $F(x) = \frac{Ax + B}{Cx + D}$ as a matrix $$\begin{pmatrix} A & B\\ C& D \end{pmatrix}$$. Function composition and evaluation then become matrix multiplication.

Now in general, $f^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{pmatrix}$ .

In our problem $f^2(x) = x$. It follows that $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c& d \end{pmatrix} = K \begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{pmatrix}$ ,

for some nonzero real $K$. Since $\frac{a}{d} = \frac{b}{-b} = K,$ it follows that $a = -d$. (In fact, this condition condition is equivalent to the condition that $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.)

We next note that the function $g(x) = x - f(x) = \frac{c x^2 + (d-a) x - b}{cx + d}$ evaluates to 0 when $x$ equals 19 and 97. Therefore $\frac{c x^2 + (d-a) x - b}{cx+d} = g(x) = \frac{c(x-19)(x-97)}{cx+d}.$ Thus $-19 - 97 = \frac{d-a}{c} = -\frac{2a}{c}$, so $a/c = (19+97)/2 = 58$, our answer.
Solution 4

Any number that is not in the domain of the inverse of $f(x)$ cannot be in the range of $f(x)$. Starting with $f(x) = \frac{ax+b}{cx+d}$, we rearrange some things to get $x = \frac{b-f(x)d}{f(x)c-a}$. Clearly, $\frac{a}{c}$ is the number that is outside the range of $f(x)$.

Since we are given $f(f(x))=x$, we have that 

$x = \frac{a\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}+b}{c\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}+d} = \frac{a^2x +ab+bcx+bd}{acx+bc+cdx+d^2} = \frac{x(bc+a^2)+b(a+d)}{cx(a+d)+(bc+d^2)}$ 

$cx^2(a+d)+x(bc+d^2) = x(bc+a^2) + b(a+d)$ 

All the quadratic terms, linear terms, and constant terms must be equal on both sides for this to be a true statement so we have that $a = -d$.

This solution follows in the same manner as the last paragraph of the first solution.

Let $f(x) = \Big|\big||x|-2\big|-1\Big|$, $f(x) \ge 0$. Then $f(x) + f(y) = 1 \Longrightarrow f(x), f(y) \le 1 \Longrightarrow x, y \le 4$. 

We only have a $4\times 4$ area, so guessing points and graphing won't be too bad of an idea. Since $f(x) = f(-x)$, there's a symmetry about all four quadrants, so just consider the first quadrant. We now gather some points:
| $f(1) = 0$     | $f(0.1) = 0.9$ |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| $f(2) = 1$     | $f(0.9) = 0.1$ |
| $f(3) = 0$     | $f(1.1) = 0.1$ |
| $f(4) = 1$     | $f(1.9) = 0.9$ |
| $f(0.5) = 0.5$ | $f(2.1) = 0.9$ |
| $f(1.5) = 1.5$ | $f(2.9) = 0.1$ |
| $f(2.5) = 2.5$ | $f(3.1) = 0.1$ |
| $f(3.5) = 3.5$ | $f(3.9) = 0.9$ |

We can now graph the pairs of coordinates which add up to $1$. Just using the first column of information gives us an interesting lattice pattern:

Calculating the lengths is now easy; each rectangle has sides of $\sqrt{2}, 3\sqrt{2}$, so the answer is $4(\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2}) = 16\sqrt{2}$. For all four quadrants, this is $64\sqrt{2}$, and $a+b=\boxed{066}$.
Solution 2

Since $0 \le \Big|\big||x| - 2\big| - 1\Big| \le 1$ and $0 \le \Big|\big||y| - 2\big| - 1\Big| \le 1$
$- 1 \le \big||x| - 2\big| - 1 \le 1$
$0 \le \big||x| - 2\big| \le 2$
$- 2 \le |x| - 2 \le 2$
$- 4 \le x \le 4$
Also $- 4 \le y \le 4$.

Define $f(a) = \Big|\big||a| - 2\big| - 1\Big|$.

If $0 \le a \le 1$:

$f(3 + a) = \Big|\big||3 + a| - 2\big| - 1\Big| = a$
$f(3 - a) = \Big|\big||3 - a| - 2\big| - 1\Big| = a$
$f(3 + a) = f(3 - a)$

If $0 \le a \le 2$:

$f(2 + a) = \Big|\big||2 + a| - 2\big| - 1\Big| = a - 1$
$f(2 - a) = \Big|\big||2 - a| - 2\big| - 1\Big| = a - 1$
$f(2 + a) = f(2 - a)$

If $0 \le a \le 4$:

$f(a) = \Big|\big||a| - 2\big| - 1\Big| = a - 3$
$f( - a) = \Big|\big|| - a| - 2\big| - 1\Big| = a - 3$
$f(a) = f( - a)$

So the graph of $y(x)$ at $3 \le x \le 4$ is symmetric to $y(x)$ at $2 \le x \le 3$ (reflected over the line x=3)
And the graph of $y(x)$ at $2 \le x \le 4$ is symmetric to $y(x)$ at $0 \le x \le 2$ (reflected over the line x=2)
And the graph of $y(x)$ at $0 \le x \le 4$ is symmetric to $y(x)$ at $- 4 \le x \le 0$ (reflected over the line x=0)

[this is also true for horizontal reflection, with $3 \le y \le 4$, etc]

So it is only necessary to find the length of the function at $3 \le x \le 4$ and $3 \le y \le 4$: $\Big|\big||x| - 2\big| - 1\Big| + \Big|\big||y| - 2\big| - 1\Big| = 1$
$x - 3 + y - 3 = 1$
$y = - x + 7$ (Length = $\sqrt {2}$)

This graph is reflected over the line y=3, the quantity of which is reflected over y=2,

the quantity of which is reflected over y=0,
the quantity of which is reflected over x=3,
the quantity of which is reflected over x=2,
the quantity of which is reflected over x=0..

So a total of $6$ doublings = $2^6$ = $64$, the total length = $64 \cdot \sqrt {2} = a\sqrt {b}$, and $a + b = 64 + 2 = \boxed{066}$.


## 1997 AIME Problem 15

The sides of rectangle $ABCD$ have lengths $10$ and $11$. An equilateral triangle is drawn so that no point of the triangle lies outside $ABCD$. The maximum possible area of such a triangle can be written in the form $p\sqrt{q}-r$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are positive integers, and $q$ is not divisible by the square of any prime number. Find $p+q+r$.

Solution 1

Consider points on the complex plane $A (0,0),\ B (11,0),\ C (11,10),\ D (0,10)$. Since the rectangle is quite close to a square, we figure that the area of the equilateral triangle is maximized when a vertex of the triangle coincides with that of the rectangle. Set one vertex of the triangle at $A$, and the other two points $E$ and $F$ on $BC$ and $CD$, respectively. Let $E (11,a)$ and $F (b, 10)$. Since it's equilateral, then $E\cdot\text{cis}60^{\circ} = F$, so $(11 + ai)\left(\frac {1}{2} + \frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}i\right) = b + 10i$, and expanding we get $\left(\frac {11}{2} - \frac {a\sqrt {3}}{2}\right) + \left(\frac {11\sqrt {3}}{2} + \frac {a}{2}\right)i = b + 10i$.

We can then set the real and imaginary parts equal, and solve for $(a,b) = (20 - 11\sqrt {3},22 - 10\sqrt {3})$. Hence a side $s$ of the equilateral triangle can be found by $s^2 = AE^2 = a^2 + AB^2 = 884 - 440\sqrt{3}$. Using the area formula $\frac{s^2\sqrt{3}}{4}$, the area of the equilateral triangle is $\frac{(884-440\sqrt{3})\sqrt{3}}{4} = 221\sqrt{3} - 330$. Thus $p + q + r = 221 + 3 + 330 = \boxed{554}$.
Solution 2

This is a trigonometric re-statement of the above. Let $x = \angle EAB$; by alternate interior angles, $\angle DFA=60+x$. Let $a = EB$ and the side of the equilateral triangle be $s$, so $s= \sqrt{a^2+121}$ by the Pythagorean Theorem. Now $\frac{10}{s} = \sin(60+x)= \sin {60} \cos x+ \cos {60} \sin x = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}2\right)\left(\frac{11}s\right)+\left(\frac 12\right)\left( \frac as \right)$. This reduces to $a=20-11\sqrt{3}$.

Thus, the area of the triangle is $\frac{s^2\sqrt{3}}{4} =(a^2+121)\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$, which yields the same answer as above.
Solution 3

Since $\angle{BAD}=90$ and $\angle{EAF}=60$, it follows that $\angle{DAF}+\angle{BAE}=90-60=30$. Rotate triangle $ADF$ $60$ degrees clockwise. Note that the image of $AF$ is $AE$. Let the image of $D$ be $D'$. Since angles are preserved under rotation, $\angle{DAF}=\angle{D'AE}$. It follows that $\angle{D'AE}+\angle{BAE}=\angle{D'AB}=30$. Since $\angle{ADF}=\angle{ABE}=90$, it follows that quadrilateral $ABED'$ is cyclic with circumdiameter $AE=s$ and thus circumradius $\frac{s}{2}$. Let $O$ be its circumcenter. By Inscribed Angles, $\angle{BOD'}=2\angle{BAD}=60$. By the definition of circle, $OB=OD'$. It follows that triangle $OBD'$ is equilateral. Therefore, $BD'=r=\frac{s}{2}$. Applying the Law of Cosines to triangle $ABD'$, $\frac{s}{2}=\sqrt{9^2+10^2-(2)(9)(10)(\cos{30})}$. Squaring and multiplying by $\sqrt{3}$ yields $\frac{s^2\sqrt{3}}{4}=221\sqrt{3}-330\implies{p+q+r=221+3+330=\boxed{554}}$

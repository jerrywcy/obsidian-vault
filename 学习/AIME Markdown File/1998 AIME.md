## 1998 AIME Problem 1

For how many values of $k$ is $12^{12}$ the least common multiple of the positive integers $6^6$, $8^8$, and $k$?
Solution

It is evident that $k$ has only 2s and 3s in its prime factorization, or $k = 2^a3^b$.

$6^6 = 2^6\cdot3^6$
$8^8 = 2^{24}$
$12^{12} = 2^{24}\cdot3^{12}$

The LCM of any numbers an be found by writing out their factorizations and taking the greatest power for each factor. $[6^6,8^8] = 2^{24}3^6$. Therefore $12^{12} = 2^{24}\cdot3^{12} = [2^{24}3^6,2^a3^b] = 2^{\max(24,a)}3^{\max(6,b)}$, and $b = 12$. Since $0 \le a \le 24$, there are $\boxed{025}$ values of $k$.


## 1998 AIME Problem 2

Find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of positive integers that satisfy $x \le 2y \le 60$ and $y \le 2x \le 60$.

Pick's theorem states that:
$A = I + \frac B2 - 1$

The conditions give us four inequalities: $x \le 30$, $y\le 30$, $x \le 2y$, $y \le 2x$. These create a quadrilateral, whose area is $\frac 12$ of the 30 by 30 square it is in. A simple way to see this is to note that the two triangles outside of the quadrilateral form half of the area of the 30 by 30 square.

So $A = \frac 12 \cdot 30^2 = 450$. $B$ we can calculate by just counting. Ignoring the vertices, the top and right sides have 14 lattice points, and the two diagonals each have 14 lattice points (for the top diagonal, every value of $x$ corresponds with an integer value of $y$ as $y = 2x$ and vice versa for the bottom, so and there are 14 values for x not counting vertices). Adding the four vertices, there are 60 points on the borders.
$450 = I + \frac {60}2 - 1$
$I = 421$

Since the inequalities also include the equals case, we include the boundaries, which gives us $421 + 60 = 481$ ordered pairs. However, the question asks us for positive integers, so $(0,0)$ doesn't count; hence, the answer is $480$.
Solution 2

First, note that all pairs of the form $(a,a)$, $1\le a\le30$ work.

Now, considered the ordered pairs with $x < y$, so that $x < 2y$ is automatically satisfied. Since $x < y\le 2x$, there are $2x - x = x$ possible values of $y$. Hence, given $x$, there are $x$ values of possible $y$ for which $x < y$ and the above conditions are satisfied. But $2y\le60$, so this only works for $x\le15$. Thus, there are

$\sum_{i=1}^{15} i=\frac{(15)(16)}{2}$

ordered pairs. For $x > 15$, $y$ must follow $x < y\le 30$. Hence, there are $30 - x$ possibilities for $y$, and there are

$\sum_{i=16}^{30}(30-i)=\sum_{i=0}^{14}i=\frac{(14)(15)}{2}$

ordered pairs.

By symmetry, there are also $\frac {(15)(16)}{2} + \frac {(14)(15)}{2}$ ordered pairs with $x > y$ and the above criteria satisfied.

Hence, the total is

$\frac{(15)(16)}{2}+\frac{(14)(15)}{2}+\frac{(15)(16)}{2}+\frac{(14)(15)}{2}+30=480.$
Solution 3

$y\le2x\le60$

Multiplying both sides by 2 yields:

$2y\le4x\le120$

Then the two inequalities can be merged to form the following inequality:

$x\le2y\le4x\le120$

Additionally, we must ensure that $2y<60$

Therefore we must find pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy the inequality above. A bit of trial and error and observing patterns leads to the answer $480$.

It should be noted that the cases for $x\le15$ and $x>15$ should be considered separately in order to ensure that $2y < 60$.


## 1998 AIME Problem 3

The graph of $y^2 + 2xy + 40|x|= 400$ partitions the plane into several regions. What is the area of the bounded region?
Solution

$40|x| = - y^2 - 2xy + 400$

We can split the equation into a piecewise equation by breaking up the absolute value:

$40x = -y^2 - 2xy + 400\quad\quad x\ge 0$
$40x = y^2 + 2xy - 400 \quad \quad x < 0$

Factoring the first one: (alternatively, it is also possible to complete the square)

$40x + 2xy = -y^2 + 400$
$2x(20 + y)= (20 - y)(20 + y)$

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/thumb/1/18/AIME_1998-3.png/300px-AIME_1998-3.png" height="150px" /></div>

Hence, either $y = -20$, or $2x = 20 - y \Longrightarrow y = -2x + 20$.

Similarily, for the second one, we get $y = 20$ or $y = -2x - 20$. If we graph these four equations, we see that we get a parallelogram with base 20 and height 40. Hence the answer is $\boxed{800}$.


## 1998 AIME Problem 4

Nine tiles are numbered $1, 2, 3, \cdots, 9,$ respectively. Each of three players randomly selects and keeps three of the tiles, and sums those three values. The probability that all three players obtain an odd sum is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$
Solution

In order for a player to have an odd sum, he must have an odd number of odd tiles: that is, he can either have three odd tiles, or two even tiles and an odd tile. Thus, since there are $5$ odd tiles and $4$ even tiles, the only possibility is that one player gets $3$ odd tiles and the other two players get $2$ even tiles and $1$ odd tile. We count the number of ways this can happen. (We will count assuming that it matters in what order the people pick the tiles; the final answer is the same if we assume the opposite, that order doesn't matter.)

We have $3$ choices for the player who will get three odd tiles, and $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ choices for the tiles that he gets. The other two odd tiles can be distributed to the other two players in $2$ ways, and the even tiles can be distributed between them in $\binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{2} = 6$ ways. This gives us a total of $3\cdot 10 \cdot 2 \cdot 6 = 360$ possibilities in which all three people get odd sums.

In order to calculate the probability, we need to know the total number of possible distributions for the tiles. The first player needs three tiles which we can give him in $\binom{9}{3} = 84$ ways, and the second player needs three of the remaining six, which we can give him in $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways. Finally, the third player will simply take the remaining tiles in $1$ way. So, there are $\binom{9}{3} \cdot \binom{6}{3} \cdot 1 = 84 \cdot 20 = 1680$ ways total to distribute the tiles.

Thus, the total probability is $\frac{360}{1680} = \frac{3}{14},$ so the answer is $3 + 14 = \boxed{017}$.


## 1998 AIME Problem 5

Given that $A_k = \frac {k(k - 1)}2\cos\frac {k(k - 1)\pi}2,$ find $|A_{19} + A_{20} + \cdots + A_{98}|.$
Solution

Though the problem may appear to be quite daunting, it is actually not that difficult. $\frac {k(k-1)}2$ always evaluates to an integer (triangular number), and the cosine of $n\pi$ where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ is 1 if $n$ is even and -1 if $n$ is odd. $\frac {k(k-1)}2$ will be even if $4|k$ or $4|k-1$, and odd otherwise.

So our sum looks something like:

$\left|\sum_{i=19}^{98} A_i\right| =- \frac{19(18)}{2} + \frac{20(19)}{2} + \frac{21(20)}{2} - \frac{22(21)}{2} - \frac{23(22)}{2} + \frac{24(23)}{2} \cdots - \frac{98(97)}{2}$

If we group the terms in pairs, we see that we need a formula for $\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + \frac{n+1(n)}{2} = \left(\frac n2\right)(n+1 - (n-1)) = n$. So the first two fractions add up to $19$, the next two to $-21$, and so forth.

If we pair the terms again now, each pair adds up to $-2$. There are $\frac{98-19+1}{2 \cdot 2} = 20$ such pairs, so our answer is $|-2 \cdot 20| = \boxed{040}$.


## 1998 AIME Problem 6


Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram. Extend $\overline{DA}$ through $A$ to a point $P,$ and let $\overline{PC}$ meet $\overline{AB}$ at $Q$ and $\overline{DB}$ at $R.$ Given that $PQ = 735$ and $QR = 112,$ find $RC.$
Solution
Solution 1

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/thumb/2/2e/AIME_1998-6.png/350px-AIME_1998-6.png" height="200px" /></div>

There are several similar triangles. $\triangle PAQ\sim \triangle PDC$, so we can write the proportion:

$\frac{AQ}{CD} = \frac{PQ}{PC} = \frac{735}{112 + 735 + RC} = \frac{735}{847 + RC}$

Also, $\triangle BRQ\sim DRC$, so:

$\frac{QR}{RC} = \frac{QB}{CD} = \frac{112}{RC} = \frac{CD - AQ}{CD} = 1 - \frac{AQ}{CD}$

$\frac{AQ}{CD} = 1 - \frac{112}{RC} = \frac{RC - 112}{RC}$

Substituting,

$\frac{AQ}{CD} = \frac{735}{847 + RC} = \frac{RC - 112}{RC}$

$735RC = (RC + 847)(RC - 112)$
$0 = RC^2 - 112\cdot847$

Thus, $RC = \sqrt{112*847} = 308$.
Solution 2

We have $\triangle BRQ\sim \triangle DRC$ so $\frac{112}{RC} = \frac{BR}{DR}$. We also have $\triangle BRC \sim \triangle DRP$ so $\frac{ RC}{847} = \frac {BR}{DR}$. Equating the two results gives $\frac{112}{RC} = \frac{ RC}{847}$ and so $RC^2=112*847$ which solves to $RC=\boxed{308}$


## 1998 AIME Problem 7


Let $n$ be the number of ordered quadruples $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$ of positive odd integers that satisfy $\sum_{i = 1}^4 x_i = 98.$ Find $\frac n{100}.$
Solution
Solution 1

Define $x_i = 2y_i - 1$. Then $2\left(\sum_{i = 1}^4 y_i\right) - 4 = 98$, so $\sum_{i = 1}^4 y_i = 51$.

So we want to find four integers that sum up to 51; we can imagine this as trying to split up 51 on the number line into 4 ranges. This is equivalent to trying to place 3 markers on the numbers 1 through 50; thus the answer is $n = {50\choose3} = \frac{50 * 49 * 48}{3 * 2} = 19600$, and $\frac n{100} = \boxed{196}$.
Solution 2

Another way we can approach this problem is by imagining a line of 98 stones. We want to place the stones into $4$ boxes so that each box has an odd number of stones. We then proceed by placing one stone in each box to begin with, ensuring that we have a positive number in every box. Now we have $94$ stones left. Because we want an odd number in each box, we pair the stones, creating $47$ sets of $2$. Every time we add a pair to one of the boxes, the number of stones in the box remains odd, because (an odd #) + (an even #) = (an odd #).

Our problem can now be restated: how many ways are there to partition a line of $47$ stones? We can easily solve this by using $3$ sticks to separate the stones into $4$ groups, and this is the same as arranging a line of $3$ sticks and $47$ stones. $\frac{50!}{47! \cdot 3!} = 19600$ $\frac{50 * 49 * 48}{3 * 2} = 19600$ Our answer is therefore $\frac{19600}{100} = \boxed{196}$


## 1998 AIME Problem 8

Except for the first two terms, each term of the sequence $1000, x, 1000 - x,\ldots$ is obtained by subtracting the preceding term from the one before that. The last term of the sequence is the first negative term encounted. What positive integer $x$ produces a sequence of maximum length?

Solution

The best way to start is to just write out some terms.
0 	1 	2 	3 	4 	5 	6
$\quad 1000 \quad$aa 	$\quad x \quad$aaa 	$1000 - x$ 	$2x - 1000$a 	$2000 - 3x$ 	$5x - 3000$ 	$5000 - 8x$

By now its obvious that the numbers are related to the Fibonacci numbers.

Thus,

$n \equiv 0 \mod{2}\quad\quad F_{n-1}\cdot 1000-F_n\cdot x$
$n \equiv 1 \mod{2}\quad\quad F_{n}\cdot 1000-F_{n-1}\cdot x$

Solution 1

We can start to write out some of the inequalities now:

$x > 0$
$1000 - x > 0 \Longrightarrow x < 1000$
$2x - 1000 > 0 \Longrightarrow x > 500$
$3000 - 2x > 0 \Longrightarrow x < 666.\overline{6}$
$5x - 3000 > 0 \Longrightarrow x > 600$

And in general,

$n \equiv 0 \mod{2}\quad\quad x < \frac{F_{n-1}}{F_n} \cdot 1000$
$n \equiv 1 \mod{2}\quad\quad x > \frac{F_{n-1}}{F_{n}} \cdot 1000$

It is apparent that the bounds are slowly closing in on $x$, so we can just calculate $x$ for some large value of $n$ (randomly, 10, 11):

$x < \frac{F_{9}}{F_{10}} \cdot 1000 = \frac{34}{55} \cdot 1000 = 618.\overline{18}$

$x > \frac{F_{10}}{F_{11}} \cdot 1000 = \frac{55}{89} \cdot 1000 \approx 617.977$

Thus the sequence is maximized when $x = 618$.
Solution 2

It is well known that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \frac{F_{n-1}}{F_n} = \phi - 1 =\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 1 \approx .61803$, so $1000 \cdot \frac{F_{n-1}}{F_n}$ approaches $x = 618$.


## 1998 AIME Problem 9

Two mathematicians take a morning coffee break each day. They arrive at the cafeteria independently, at random times between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., and stay for exactly $m$ minutes. The probability that either one arrives while the other is in the cafeteria is $40 \%,$ and $m = a - b\sqrt {c},$ where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a + b + c.$

Solution
Solution 1

Let the two mathematicians be $M_1$ and $M_2$. Consider plotting the times that they are on break on a coordinate plane with one axis being the time $M_1$ arrives and the second axis being the time $M_2$ arrives (in minutes past 9 a.m.). The two mathematicians meet each other when $|M_1-M_2| \leq m$. Also because the mathematicians arrive between 9 and 10, $0 \leq M_1,M_2 \leq 60$. Therefore, $60\times 60$ square represents the possible arrival times of the mathematicians, while the shaded region represents the arrival times where they meet. 

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/6/6/e/66e5295ca62e55f572267d31580c6761602f96df.png" height="150px" /></div>

It's easier to compete the area of the unshaded region over the area of the total region, which is the probability that the mathematicians do not meet:

$\frac{(60-m)^2}{60^2} = .6$
$(60-m)^2 = 36\cdot 60$
$60 - m = 12\sqrt{15}$
$\Rightarrow m = 60-12\sqrt{15}$

So the answer is $60 + 12 + 15 = 087$.
Solution 2

Case 1:

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/8/86/AIME_1998-9.png" height="100px" /></div>

Case 2:

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/7/7a/AIME_1998-9b.png" height="100px" /></div>

We draw a number line representing the time interval. If mathematician $M_1$ comes in at the center of the time period, then the two mathematicions will meet if $M_2$ comes in somewhere between $m$ minutes before and after $M_1$ comes (a total range of $2m$ minutes). However, if $M_1$ comes into the cafeteria in the first or last $m$ minutes, then the range in which $M_2$ is reduced to somewhere in between $m$ and $2m$.

We know try to find the weighted average of the chance that the two meet. In the central $60-2m$ minutes, $M_1$ and $M_2$ have to enter the cafeteria within $m$ minutes of each other; so if we fix point $M_1$ then $M_2$ has a $\frac{2m}{60} = \frac{m}{30}$ probability of meeting.

In the first and last $2m$ minutes, the probability that the two meet ranges from $\frac{m}{60}$ to $\frac{2m}{60}$, depending upon the location of $M_1$ with respect to the endpoints. Intuitively, the average probability will occur at $\frac{\frac{3}{2}m}{60} = \frac{m}{40}$.

So the weighted average is:

$\frac{\frac{m}{30}(60-2m) + \frac{m}{40}(2m)}{60} = \frac{40}{100}$
$0 = \frac{m^2}{60} - 2m + 24$
$0 = m^2 - 120m + 1440$

Solving this quadratic, we get two roots, $60 \pm 12\sqrt{15}$. However, $m < 60$, so we discard the greater root; and thus our answer $60 + 12 + 15 = 087$.


## 1998 AIME Problem 10

Eight spheres of radius 100 are placed on a flat surface so that each sphere is tangent to two others and their centers are the vertices of a regular octagon. A ninth sphere is placed on the flat surface so that it is tangent to each of the other eight spheres. The radius of this last sphere is $a +b\sqrt {c},$ where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a + b + c$.

Solution

The key is to realize the significance that the figures are spheres, not circles. The 2D analogue of the diagram onto the flat surface will not contain 8 circles tangent to a ninth one; instead the circles will overlap since the middle sphere has a larger radius and will sort of “bulge” out.

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/thumb/c/cf/1998_AIME-10a.png/450px-1998_AIME-10a.png" height="200px" /></div>

Let us examine the relation between one of the outside 8 spheres and the center one (with radius $r$):

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/thumb/d/dd/1998_AIME-10b.png/450px-1998_AIME-10b.png" height="150px" /></div>

If we draw the segment containing the centers and the radii perpendicular to the flat surface, we get a trapezoid; if we draw the segment parallel to the surface that connects the center of the smaller sphere to the radii of the larger, we get a right triangle. Call that segment $x$. Then by the Pythagorean Theorem:

$x^2 + (r-100)^2 = (r+100)^2 \Longrightarrow x = 20\sqrt{r}$

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/thumb/8/83/1998_AIME-10c.png/450px-1998_AIME-10c.png" height="200px" /></div>

$x$ is the distance from one of the vertices of the octagon to the center, so the diagonal of the octagon is of length $2x =40\sqrt{r}$. We can draw another right triangle as shown above. One leg has a length of $200$. The other can be found by partitioning the leg into three sections and using $45-45-90 \triangle$s to see that the leg is $100\sqrt{2} + 200 + 100\sqrt{2} = 200(\sqrt{2} + 1)$. Pythagorean Theorem:

$\begin{eqnarray*} (40\sqrt{r})^2 &=& 200^2 + [200(\sqrt{2}+1)]^2\\ 1600r &=& 200^2[(1 + \sqrt{2})^2 + 1] \\ r &=& 100 + 50\sqrt{2} \end{eqnarray*}$

Thus $a + b + c = 100 + 50 + 2 = \boxed{152}$.

## 1998 AIME Problem 11

Three of the edges of a cube are $\overline{AB}, \overline{BC},$ and $\overline{CD},$ and $\overline{AD}$ is an interior diagonal. Points $P, Q,$ and $R$ are on $\overline{AB}, \overline{BC},$ and $\overline{CD},$ respectively, so that $AP = 5, PB = 15, BQ = 15,$ and $CR = 10.$ What is the area of the polygon that is the intersection of plane $PQR$ and the cube?

Solution
Solution 1

For non-asymptote version of image, see 

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/c/c/0/cc024d2670aaa65c924626f7202dd7e39ce014b5.png" height="150px" /></div>

This approach uses analytical geometry. Let $A$ be at the origin, $B$ at $(20,0,0)$, $C$ at $(20,0,20)$, and $D$ at $(20,20,20)$. Thus, $P$ is at $(5,0,0)$, $Q$ is at $(20,0,15)$, and $R$ is at $(20,10,20)$.

Let the plane $PQR$ have the equation $ax + by + cz = d$. Using point $P$, we get that $5a = d$. Using point $Q$, we get $20a + 15c = d \Longrightarrow 4d + 15c = d \Longrightarrow d = -5c$. Using point $R$, we get $20a + 10b + 20c = d \Longrightarrow 4d + 10b - 4d = d \Longrightarrow d = 10b$. Thus plane $PQR$’s equation reduces to $\frac{d}{5}x + \frac{d}{10}y - \frac{d}{5}z = d \Longrightarrow 2x + y - 2z = 10$.

We know need to find the intersection of this plane with that of $z = 0$, $z = 20$, $x = 0$, and $y = 20$. After doing a little bit of algebra, the intersections are the lines $y = -2x + 10$, $y = -2x + 50$, $y = 2z + 10$, and $z = x + 5$. Thus, there are three more vertices on the polygon, which are at $(0,10,0)(0,20,5)(15,20,20)$.

We can find the lengths of the sides of the polygons now. There are 4 right triangles with legs of length 5 and 10, so their hypotenuses are $5\sqrt{5}$. The other two are of $45-45-90 \triangle$s with legs of length 15, so their hypotenuses are $15\sqrt{2}$. So we have a hexagon with sides $15\sqrt{2},5\sqrt{5}, 5\sqrt{5},15\sqrt{2}, 5\sqrt{5},5\sqrt{5}$ By symmetry, we know that opposite angles of the polygon are congruent. We can also calculate the length of the long diagonal by noting that it is of the same length of a face diagonal, making it $20\sqrt{2}$.

<div align=center><img src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/e/a/7/ea7bc05babcdcc882d8ac16161375c66d2551c11.png" height="150px" /></div>

The height of the triangles at the top/bottom is $\frac{20\sqrt{2} - 15\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{5}{2}\sqrt{2}$. The Pythagorean Theorem gives that half of the base of the triangles is $\frac{15}{\sqrt{2}}$. We find that the middle rectangle is actually a square, so the total area is $(15\sqrt{2})^2 + 4\left(\frac 12\right)\left(\frac 52\sqrt{2}\right)\left(\frac{15}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 525$.
Solution 2

First, note that whenever the plane intersects two opposite faces of the cube, the resulting line segments must be parallel. Because they are part of parallel planes (the faces), they must be either parallel or skew; they are both part of plane $PQR$, so they cannot be skew. Therefore, they are parallel.

Let the cube's vertices be $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, $F$, $G$, and $H$, with $A$, $B$, and $C$ on the bottom face as before, $H$ being the other bottom vertex, $D$ directly above $C$, $E$ above $B$, $F$ above $A$, and $G$ above $H$.

Clearly, the next vertex of the intersection (starting with $P$, $Q$, $R$) will be somewhere on $DG$. Let it be $X$, and have a distance of $x$ from D, and a distance of $20 - x$ from $G$.

Then, the next vertex will be somewhere on $FG$. It must be parallel to $PQ$, so this implies that it has a distance of $20 - x$ from $G$, and thus a distance of $x$ from $F$.

Now, the next vertex (call it $Y$) will be somewhere on $AF$. The segment must be parallel to $QR$, so $FY$ must have length $2x$, and $AY$ must be $20 - 2x$.

Since $DX \parallel AP$, $DR \parallel AY$, and $RX \parallel PY$, we must have $\triangle{APY} \sim \triangle{DXR}$; therefore, $\frac{AP}{DX}=\frac{AY}{DR}$ $\frac{5}{x}=\frac{20-2x}{10}$ $x^{2}-10x+25=0$ $x=5$

We can now find that the hexagon has side lengths $15\sqrt {2}$, $5\sqrt {5}$, $5\sqrt {5}$, $15\sqrt {2}$, $5\sqrt {5}$, and $5\sqrt {5}$. Moreover, opposite angles of this must be equal (by symmetry), so segment $RY$ divides the hexagon into two isosceles trapezoids. It is easy to find the length of $RY$ (they're midpoints of opposite edges, so the distance between the two points is equal to a face diagonal of the cube, or $20\sqrt {2}$), so it is now easy to finish the problem.

## 1998 AIME Problem 12

Let $ABC$ be equilateral, and $D, E,$ and $F$ be the midpoints of $\overline{BC}, \overline{CA},$ and $\overline{AB},$ respectively. There exist points $P, Q,$ and $R$ on $\overline{DE}, \overline{EF},$ and $\overline{FD},$ respectively, with the property that $P$ is on $\overline{CQ}, Q$ is on $\overline{AR},$ and $R$ is on $\overline{BP}.$ The ratio of the area of triangle $ABC$ to the area of triangle $PQR$ is $a + b\sqrt {c},$ where $a, b$ and $c$ are integers, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. What is $a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2}$?

Solution

We let $x = EP = FQ$, $y = EQ$, $k = PQ$. Since $AE = \frac {1}{2}AB$ and $AD = \frac {1}{2}AC$, $\triangle AED \sim \triangle ABC$ and $ED \parallel BC$.

By alternate interior angles, we have $\angle PEQ = \angle BFQ$ and $\angle EPQ = \angle FBQ$. By vertical angles, $\angle EQP = \angle FQB$.

Thus $\triangle EQP \sim \triangle FQB$, so $\frac {EP}{EQ} = \frac {FB}{FQ}\Longrightarrow\frac {x}{y} = \frac {1}{x}\Longrightarrow x^{2} = y$.

Since $\triangle EDF$ is equilateral, $EQ + FQ = EF = BF = 1\Longrightarrow x + y = 1$. Solving for $x$ and $y$ using $x^{2} = y$ and $x + y = 1$ gives $x = \frac {\sqrt {5} - 1}{2}$ and $y = \frac {3 - \sqrt {5}}{2}$.

Using the Law of Cosines, we get
$k^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2} - 2xy\cos{\frac {\pi}{3}}$

$= \left(\frac {\sqrt {5} - 1}{2}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac {3 - \sqrt {5}}{2}\right)^{2} - 2\left(\frac {\sqrt {5} - 1}{2}\right)\left(\frac {3 - \sqrt {5}}{2}\right)\cos{\frac {\pi}{3}}$
$= 7 - 3\sqrt {5}$

We want the ratio of the squares of the sides, so $\frac {(2)^{2}}{k^{2}} = \frac {4}{7 - 3\sqrt {5}} = 7 + 3\sqrt {5}$ so $a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2} = 7^{2} + 3^{2} + 5^{2} = \boxed{083}$.

If $\{a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots,a_n\}$ is a set of real numbers, indexed so that $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < \cdots < a_n,$ its complex power sum is defined to be $a_1i + a_2i^2+ a_3i^3 + \cdots + a_ni^n,$ where $i^2 = - 1.$ Let $S_n$ be the sum of the complex power sums of all nonempty subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}.$ Given that $S_8 = - 176 - 64i$ and $S_9 = p + qi,$ where $p$ and $q$ are integers, find $|p| + |q|.$
Solution

We note that the number of subsets (for now, including the empty subset, which we will just define to have a power sum of zero) with $9$ in it is equal to the number of subsets without a $9$. To easily see this, take all possible subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,8\}$. Since the sets are ordered, a $9$ must go at the end; hence we can just append a $9$ to any of those subsets to get a new one.

Now that we have drawn that bijection, we can calculate the complex power sum recursively. Since appending a $9$ to a subset doesn't change anything about that subset's complex power sum besides adding an additional term, we have that $S_9 = 2S_8 + T_9$, where $T_9$ refers to the sum of all of the $9i^x$.

It a subset of size 1 has a 9, then its power sum must be $9i$, and there is only $1$ of these such subsets. There are ${8\choose1}$ with $9\cdot i^2$, ${8\choose2}$ with $9\cdot i^3$, and so forth. So $T_9 =\sum_{k=0}^{8} 9{8\choose{k}}i^{k+1}$. This is exactly the binomial expansion of $9i \cdot (1+i)^8$. We can use De Moivre's Theorem to calculate the power: $(\sqrt{2})^8\cos{8\cdot45} = 16$. Hence $T_9 = 16\cdot9i = 144i$, and $S_9 = 2S_8 + 144i = 2(-176 -64i) + 144i = -352 + 16i$. Thus, $|p| + |q| = |-352| + |16| = 368$.


## 1998 AIME Problem 14


An $m\times n\times p$ rectangular box has half the volume of an $(m + 2)\times(n + 2)\times(p + 2)$ rectangular box, where $m, n,$ and $p$ are integers, and $m\le n\le p.$ What is the largest possible value of $p$?
Solution 1

$2mnp = (m+2)(n+2)(p+2)$

Let’s solve for $p$:

$(2mn)p = p(m+2)(n+2) + 2(m+2)(n+2)$ $[2mn - (m+2)(n+2)]p = 2(m+2)(n+2)$ $p = \frac{2(m+2)(n+2)}{mn - 2n - 2m - 4} = \frac{2(m+2)(n+2)}{(m-2)(n-2) - 8}$

Clearly, we want to minimize the denominator, so we test $(m-2)(n-2) - 8 = 1 \Longrightarrow (m-2)(n-2) = 9$. The possible pairs of factors of $9$ are $(1,9)(3,3)$. These give $m = 3, n = 11$ and $m = 5, n = 5$ respectively. Substituting into the numerator, we see that the first pair gives $130$, while the second pair gives $98$. We now check that $130$ is optimal, setting $a=m-2$, $b=n-2$ in order to simplify calculations. Since $0 \le (a-1)(b-1) \implies a+b \le ab+1$ We have $p = \frac{2(a+4)(b+4)}{ab-8} = \frac{2ab+8(a+b)+32}{ab-8} \le \frac{2ab+8(ab+1)+32}{ab-8} = 10 + \frac{120}{ab-8} \le 130$ Where we see $(m,n)=(3,11)$ gives us our maximum value of $\boxed{130}$.

Note that $0 \le (a-1)(b-1)$ assumes $m,n \ge 3$, but this is clear as $\frac{2m}{m+2} = \frac{(n+2)(p+2)}{np} > 1$ and similarly for $n$.

Solution 2

Similarly as above, we solve for $p,$ but we express the denominator differently:

$p=\frac{2(m+2)(n+2)}{(m+2)(n+2)-4(m+n+2)} \implies \frac{1}{p}=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{2(m+n+2)}{(m+2)(n+2)}.$ Hence, it suffices to maximize $\frac{m+n+2}{(m+2)(n+2)},$ under the conditions that $p$ is a positive integer.

Then since $\frac{m+n+2}{(m+2)(n+2)}>\frac{1}{2}$ for $m=1,2,$ we fix $m=3.$ $\implies \frac{1}{p}=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{2(n+2)}{5(n+2)}=\frac{n-10}{10(n+2)},$ where we simply let $n=11$ to achieve $p=\boxed{130}.$

## 1998 AIME Problem 15

Define a domino to be an ordered pair of distinct positive integers. A proper sequence of dominos is a list of distinct dominos in which the first coordinate of each pair after the first equals the second coordinate of the immediately preceding pair, and in which $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$ do not both appear for any $i$ and $j$. Let $D_{40}$ be the set of all dominos whose coordinates are no larger than 40. Find the length of the longest proper sequence of dominos that can be formed using the dominos of $D_{40}.$
Solution

We can draw a comparison between the domino a set of 40 points (labeled 1 through 40) in which every point is connected with every other point. The connections represent the dominoes.

You need to have all even number of segments coming from each point except 0 or 2 which have an odd number of segments coming from the point. (Reasoning for this: Everytime you go to a vertex, you have to leave the vertex, so every vertex reached is equivalent to adding 2 more segments. So the degree of each vertex must be even, with the exception of endpoints) Since there are 39 segments coming from each point it is impossible to touch every segment.

But you can get up to 38 on each segment because you go in to the point then out on a different segment. Counting going out from the starting and ending at the ending point we have:

$\frac{38\cdot 40 + 2}2 = \boxed{761}$

Clarification : To clarify the above solution, every time you move to a new vertex, you take one path in and must leave by another path. Therefore every vertex needs to have an even number of segments leaving it (with the exception of the first and last), because the "in" and "out" segments must make a pair.

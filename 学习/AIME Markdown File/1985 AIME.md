## 1985 AIME Problem 1


Let $x_1=97$, and for $n>1$, let $x_n=\frac{n}{x_{n-1}}$. Calculate the product $x_1x_2x_3x_4x_5x_6x_7x_8$.
Solution

Since $x_n=\frac{n}{x_{n-1}}$, $x_n \cdot x_{n - 1} = n$. Setting $n = 2, 4, 6$ and $8$ in this equation gives us respectively $x_1x_2 = 2$, $x_3x_4 = 4$, $x_5x_6 = 6$ and $x_7x_8 = 8$ so $x_1x_2x_3x_4x_5x_6x_7x_8 = 2\cdot4\cdot6\cdot8 = \boxed{384}.$ Notice that the value of $x_1$ was completely unneeded!
Solution 2

Another way to do this is to realize that most of our numbers will be canceled out in the multiplication in the end, and to just list out the terms of our product and cancel:

$x_1x_2x_3x_4x_5x_6x_7x_8=x_1\cdot\frac{2}{x_1}\cdot\frac{3}{\frac{2}{x_1}}\cdot\frac{4}{\frac{3}{\frac{2}{x_1}}}\cdot\frac{5}{\frac{4}{\frac{3}{\frac{2}{x_1}}}}\cdot\frac{6}{\frac{5}{\frac{4}{\frac{3}{\frac{2}{x_1}}}}}\cdot\frac{7}{\frac{6}{\frac{5}{\frac{4}{\frac{3}{\frac{2}{x_1}}}}}}\cdot\frac{8}{\frac{7}{\frac{6}{\frac{5}{\frac{4}{\frac{3}{\frac{2}{x_1}}}}}}} \\ =(x_1\cdot\frac{2}{x_1})\cdot(\frac{3}{\frac{2}{x_1}}\cdot\frac{4}{\frac{3}{\frac{2}{x_1}}})\cdot(\frac{5}{\frac{4}{\frac{3}{\frac{2}{x_1}}}}\cdot\frac{6}{\frac{5}{\frac{4}{\frac{3}{\frac{2}{x_1}}}}})\cdot(\frac{7}{\frac{6}{\frac{5}{\frac{4}{\frac{3}{\frac{2}{x_1}}}}}}\cdot\frac{8}{\frac{7}{\frac{6}{\frac{5}{\frac{4}{\frac{3}{\frac{2}{x_1}}}}}}})=2\cdot 4\cdot 6\cdot 8=\boxed{384}$


## 1985 AIME Problem 2

When a right triangle is rotated about one leg, the volume of the cone produced is $800\pi \;\textrm{ cm}^3$. When the triangle is rotated about the other leg, the volume of the cone produced is $1920\pi \;\textrm{ cm}^3$. What is the length (in cm) of the hypotenuse of the triangle?
Solution

Let one leg of the triangle have length $a$ and let the other leg have length $b$. When we rotate around the leg of length $a$, the result is a cone of height $a$ and radius $b$, and so of volume $\frac 13 \pi ab^2 = 800\pi$. Likewise, when we rotate around the leg of length $b$ we get a cone of height $b$ and radius $a$ and so of volume $\frac13 \pi b a^2 = 1920 \pi$. If we divide this equation by the previous one, we get $\frac ab = \frac{\frac13 \pi b a^2}{\frac 13 \pi ab^2} = \frac{1920}{800} = \frac{12}{5}$, so $a = \frac{12}{5}b$. Then $\frac{1}{3} \pi (\frac{12}{5}b)b^2 = 800\pi$ so $b^3 = 1000$ and $b = 10$ so $a = 24$. Then by the Pythagorean Theorem, the hypotenuse has length $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \boxed{026}$.


## 1985 AIME Problem 3

Find $c$ if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers which satisfy $c=(a + bi)^3 - 107i$, where $i^2 = -1$.
Solution

Expanding out both sides of the given equation we have $c + 107i = (a^3 - 3ab^2) + (3a^2b - b^3)i$. Two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real parts and imaginary parts are equal, so $c = a^3 - 3ab^2$ and $107 = 3a^2b - b^3 = (3a^2 - b^2)b$. Since $a, b$ are integers, this means $b$ is a divisor of 107, which is a prime number. Thus either $b = 1$ or $b = 107$. If $b = 107$, $3a^2 - 107^2 = 1$ so $3a^2 = 107^2 + 1$, but $107^2 + 1$ is not divisible by 3, a contradiction. Thus we must have $b = 1$, $3a^2 = 108$ so $a^2 = 36$ and $a = 6$ (since we know $a$ is positive). Thus $c = 6^3 - 3\cdot 6 = \boxed{198}$.


## 1985 AIME Problem 4


A small square is constructed inside a square of area 1 by dividing each side of the unit square into $n$ equal parts, and then connecting the vertices to the division points closest to the opposite vertices. Find the value of $n$ if the the area of the small square is exactly $\frac1{1985}$.

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/b/b1/AIME_1985_Problem_4.png" height="150px" /></div>

Solution 1

The lines passing through $A$ and $C$ divide the square into three parts, two right triangles and a parallelogram. Using the smaller side of the parallelogram, $1/n$, as the base, where the height is 1, we find that the area of the parallelogram is $A = \frac{1}{n}$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the longer base of the parallelogram has length $l = \sqrt{1^2 + \left(\frac{n - 1}{n}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{n}\sqrt{2n^2 - 2n + 1}$, so the parallelogram has height $h = \frac{A}{l} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2n^2 - 2n + 1}}$. But the height of the parallelogram is the side of the little square, so $2n^2 - 2n + 1 = 1985$. Solving this quadratic equation gives $n = \boxed{032}$.
Solution 2

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/e/ee/Aime.png" height="150px" /></div>

Surrounding the square with area $\frac{1}{1985}$ are $4$ right triangles with hypotenuse $1$ (sides of the large square). Thus, $X + \frac{1}{1985} = 1$, where $X$ is the area of the of the 4 triangles. We can thus use proportions to solve this problem. $\begin{eqnarray*} \frac{GF}{BE}=\frac{CG}{CB}\implies \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{1985}}}{BE}=\frac{\frac{1}{n}}{1}\implies BE=\frac{n\sqrt{1985}}{1985} \end{eqnarray*}$ Also, $\begin{eqnarray*} \frac{BE}{1}=\frac{EC}{\frac{n-1}{n}}\implies EC=\frac{\sqrt{1985}}{1985}(n-1) \end{eqnarray*}$ Thus, 

$\begin{eqnarray*} 2(BE)(EC)+\frac{1}{1985}=1\\ 2n^{2}-2n+1=1985\\ n(n-1)=992 \end{eqnarray*}$ 

Simple factorization and guess and check gives us $\boxed{032}$.


## 1985 AIME Problem 5

A sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ is chosen so that $a_n = a_{n - 1} - a_{n - 2}$ for each $n \ge 3$. What is the sum of the first 2001 terms of this sequence if the sum of the first 1492 terms is 1985, and the sum of the first 1985 terms is 1492?
Solution

The problem gives us a sequence defined by a recursion, so let's calculate a few values to get a feel for how it acts. We aren't given initial values, so let $a_1 = a$ and $a_2 = b$. Then $a_3 = b - a$, $a_4 = (b - a) - b = -a$, $a_5 = -a - (b - a) = -b$, $a_6 = -b - (-a) = a - b$, $a_7 = (a - b) - (-b) = a$ and $a_8 = a - (a - b) = b$. Since the sequence is recursively defined by the first 2 terms, after this point it must continue to repeat. Thus, in particular $a_{j + 6} = a_j$ for all $j$, and so repeating this $n$ times, $a_{j + 6n} = a_j$ for all integers $n$ and $j$.

Because of this, the sum of the first 1492 terms can be greatly simplified: $1488 = 6 \cdot 248$ is the largest multiple of 6 less than 1492, so $\sum_{i = 1}^{1492} a_i = (a_{1489} + a_{1490} + a_{1491} + a_{1492})+ \sum_{i = 1}^{1488} a_i = (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4) + \sum_{n = 0}^{247}\sum_{j = 1}^6 a_{6n + j} = (a + b + (b - a) + (-a)) + \sum_{n = 0}^{247}\sum_{j = 1}^6 a_j = 2b - a$, where we can make this last step because $\sum_{j = 1}^6 a_j = 0$ and so the entire second term of our expression is zero.

Similarly, since $1980 = 6 \cdot 360$, $\sum_{i = 1}^{1985} a_i = (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5) + \sum_{i = 1}^{1980}a_i = a + b + (b - a) + (-a) + (-b) = b - a$.

Finally, $\sum_{i = 1}^{2001}a_i = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \sum_{i = 1}^{1998} a_i = a + b + (b - a) = 2b$.

Then by the givens, $2b - a = 1985$ and $b - a = 1492$ so $b = 1985 - 1492 = 493$ and so the answer is $2\cdot 493 = \boxed{986}$.


## 1985 AIME Problem 6

As shown in the figure, triangle $ABC$ is divided into six smaller triangles by lines drawn from the vertices through a common interior point. The areas of four of these triangles are as indicated. Find the area of triangle $ABC$.

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/f/f7/AIME_1985_Problem_6.png" height="150px" /></div>

Solution

Let the interior point be $P$, let the points on $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{CA}$ and $\overline{AB}$ be $D$, $E$ and $F$, respectively. Let $x$ be the area of $\triangle APE$ and $y$ be the area of $\triangle CPD$. Note that $\triangle APF$ and $\triangle BPF$ share the same altitude from $P$, so the ratio of their areas is the same as the ratio of their bases. Similarly, $\triangle ACF$ and $\triangle BCF$ share the same altitude from $C$, so the ratio of their areas is the same as the ratio of their bases. Moreover, the two pairs of bases are actually the same, and thus in the same ratio. As a result, we have: $\frac{40}{30} = \frac{124 + x}{65 + y}$ or equivalently $372 + 3x = 260 + 4y$ and so $4y = 3x+ 112$.

Applying identical reasoning to the triangles with bases $\overline{CD}$ and $\overline{BD}$, we get $\frac{y}{35} = \frac{x+y+84}{105}$ so that $3y = x + y + 84$ and $2y = x + 84$. Substituting from this equation into the previous one gives $x = 56$, from which we get $y = 70$ and so the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $56 + 40 + 30 + 35 + 70 + 84 = 315$.
Solution 2

This problem can be done using mass points. Assign B a weight of 1 and realize that many of the triangles have the same altitude. After continuously using the formulas that state (The sum of the two weights) = (The middle weight), and (The weight $\times$ side) = (Other weight) $\times$ (The other side), the problem yields the answer $315$


## 1985 AIME Problem 7

Assume that $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are positive integers such that $a^5 = b^4$, $c^3 = d^2$, and $c - a = 19$. Determine $d - b$.
Solution

It follows from the givens that $a$ is a perfect fourth power, $b$ is a perfect fifth power, $c$ is a perfect square and $d$ is a perfect cube. Thus, there exist integers $s$ and $t$ such that $a = t^4$, $b = t^5$, $c = s^2$ and $d = s^3$. So $s^2 - t^4 = 19$. We can factor the left-hand side of this equation as a difference of two squares, $(s - t^2)(s + t^2) = 19$. 19 is a prime number and $s + t^2 > s - t^2$ so we must have $s + t^2 = 19$ and $s - t^2 = 1$. Then $s = 10, t = 3$ and so $d = s^3 = 1000$, $b = t^5 = 243$ and $d-b=\boxed{757}$.


## 1985 AIME Problem 8

The sum of the following seven numbers is exactly 19: $a_1 = 2.56$, $a_2 = 2.61$, $a_3 = 2.65$, $a_4 = 2.71$, $a_5 = 2.79$, $a_6 = 2.81$, $a_7 = 2.86$. It is desired to replace each $a_i$ by an integer approximation $A_i$, $1\le i \le 7$, so that the sum of the $A_i$'s is also 19 and so that $M$, the maximum of the "errors" $\| A_i-a_i\|$, the maximum absolute value of the difference, is as small as possible. For this minimum $M$, what is $100M$?
Solution

If any of the approximations $A_i$ is less than 2 or more than 3, the error associated with that term will be larger than 1, so the largest error will be larger than 1. However, if all of the $A_i$ are 2 or 3, the largest error will be less than 1. So in the best case, we write 19 as a sum of 7 numbers, each of which is 2 or 3. Then there must be five 3s and two 2s. It is clear that in the best appoximation, the two 2s will be used to approximate the two smallest of the $a_i$, so our approximations are $A_1 = A_2 = 2$ and $A_3 = A_4 = A_5 = A_6 = A_7 = 3$ and the largest error is $|A_2 - a_2| = 0.61$, so the answer is $061$.


## 1985 AIME Problem 9

In a circle, parallel chords of lengths 2, 3, and 4 determine central angles of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\alpha + \beta$ radians, respectively, where $\alpha + \beta < \pi$. If $\cos \alpha$, which is a positive rational number, is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of its numerator and denominator?
Solution

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/c/c/c/ccc44394730c0756402714001ccba571e69a1bf7.png" height="150px" /></div>

All chords of a given length in a given circle subtend the same arc and therefore the same central angle. Thus, by the given, we can re-arrange our chords into a triangle with the circle as its circumcircle.

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/6/1/0618ad736b55ffe052dd977aed3aa0c72dca89d9.png" height="150px" /></div>

This triangle has semiperimeter $\frac{2 + 3 + 4}{2}$ so by Heron's formula it has area $K = \sqrt{\frac92 \cdot \frac52 \cdot \frac32 \cdot \frac12} = \frac{3}{4}\sqrt{15}$. The area of a given triangle with sides of length $a, b, c$ and circumradius of length $R$ is also given by the formula $K = \frac{abc}{4R}$, so $\frac6R = \frac{3}{4}\sqrt{15}$ and $R = \frac8{\sqrt{15}}$.

Now, consider the triangle formed by two radii and the chord of length 2. This isosceles triangle has vertex angle $\alpha$, so by the Law of Cosines,

$2^2 = R^2 + R^2 - 2R^2\cos \alpha \Longrightarrow \cos \alpha = \frac{2R^2 - 4}{2R^2} = \frac{17}{32}$ and the answer is $17 + 32 = \boxed{049}$.


## 1985 AIME Problem 10

How many of the first 1000 positive integers can be expressed in the form

$\lfloor 2x \rfloor + \lfloor 4x \rfloor + \lfloor 6x \rfloor + \lfloor 8x \rfloor$,

where $x$ is a real number, and $\lfloor z \rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $z$?

Solution

We will be able to reach the same number of integers while $x$ ranges from 0 to 1 as we will when $x$ ranges from $n$ to $n + 1$ for any integer $n$ (Quick proof: $\lfloor 2(n+x)\rfloor + \ldots = \lfloor 2n + 2x\rfloor + \ldots = 2n + \lfloor 2x\rfloor \ldots$). Since $\lfloor 2\cdot50 \rfloor + \lfloor 4\cdot50 \rfloor + \lfloor 6\cdot50 \rfloor + \lfloor 8\cdot50 \rfloor = 100 + 200 + 300 + 400$, the answer must be exactly 50 times the number of integers we will be able to reach as $x$ ranges from 0 to 1, including 1 but excluding 0.
Solution 1

Noting that all of the numbers are even, we can reduce this to any real number $x$ between $0$ to $\frac 12$, as this will be equivalent to $\frac n2$ to $\frac {n+1}2$ for any integer $n$ (same reasoning as above). So now we only need to test every 10 numbers; and our answer will be 100 times the number of integers we can reach between 1 and 10.

We can now approach this by directly searching for the integers (this solution) or brute forcing all of the cases (next solution):

We can match up the greatest integer functions with one of the partitions of the integer. If we let $x = \frac 12$ then we get the solution $10$; now consider when $x < \frac 12$: $\lfloor 2x \rfloor = 0$, $\lfloor 4x \rfloor \le 1$, $\lfloor 6x \rfloor \le 2$, $\lfloor 8x \rfloor \le 3$. But according to this the maximum we can get is $1+2+3 = 6$, so we only need to try the first 6 numbers.

$1$: Easily possible, for example try plugging in $x =\frac 18$.
$2$: Also simple, for example using $\frac 16$.
$3$: The partition must either be $1+1+1$ or $1+2$. If $\lfloor 4x \rfloor = 1$, then $x \ge \frac 14$, but then $\lfloor 8x \rfloor \ge 2$; not possible; and vice versa to show that the latter partition doesn't work. So we cannot obtain $3$.
$4$: We can partition as $1+1+2$, and from the previous case we see that $\frac 14$ works.
$5$: We can partition as $1+2+2$, from which we find that $\frac 13$ works.
$6$: We can partition as $1+2+3$, from which we find that $\frac 38$ works.

Out of these 6 cases, only 3 fails. So between 1 and 10 we can reach only the integers $1,2,4,5,6,10$; hence our solution is $6 \cdot 100 = 600$.
Solution 2

As we change the value of $x$, the value of our expression changes only when $x$ crosses rational number of the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $n$ is divisible by 2, 4, 6 or 8. Thus, we need only see what happens at the numbers of the form $\frac{m}{\textrm{lcm}(2, 4, 6, 8)} = \frac{m}{24}$. This gives us 24 calculations to make; we summarize the results here:

$\frac{1}{24}, \frac{2}{24} \to 0$

$\frac{3}{24} \to 1$

$\frac{4}{24}, \frac{5}{24} \to 2$

$\frac{6}{24}, \frac{7}{24} \to 4$

$\frac{8}{24} \to 5$

$\frac{9}{24}, \frac{10}{24}, \frac{11}{24} \to 6$

$\frac{12}{24}, \frac{13}{24}, \frac{14}{24} \to 10$

$\frac{15}{24} \to 11$

$\frac{16}{24},\frac{17}{24} \to 12$

$\frac{18}{24}, \frac{19}{24} \to 14$

$\frac{20}{24}\to 15$

$\frac{21}{24}, \frac{22}{24}, \frac{23}{24} \to16$

$\frac{24}{24} \to 20$

Thus, we hit 12 of the first 20 integers and so we hit $50 \cdot 12 = 600$ of the first $1000$.
Solution 3

Recall from Hermite's Identity that $\sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1}\left\lfloor x + \frac kn\right\rfloor = \lfloor nx\rfloor$. Then we can rewrite $\lfloor 2x \rfloor + \lfloor 4x \rfloor + \lfloor 6x \rfloor + \lfloor 8x \rfloor = 4\lfloor x\rfloor + \left\lfloor x + \frac18\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor x + \frac16\right\rfloor + 2\left\lfloor x + \frac14\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor x + \frac13\right\rfloor$ $+ \left\lfloor x + \frac38\right\rfloor + 4\left\lfloor x + \frac12\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor x + \frac58\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor x + \frac23\right\rfloor + 2\left\lfloor x + \frac34\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor x + \frac56\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor x + \frac78\right\rfloor$. There are $12$ terms here (we don't actually have to write all of it out; we can just see where there will be duplicates and subtract accordingly from $20$). Starting from every integer $x$, we can keep adding to achieve one higher value for each of these terms, but after raising the last term, we will have raised the whole sum by $20$ while only achieving $12$ of those $20$ values. We can conveniently shift the $1000$ (since it can be achieved) to the position of the $0$ so that there are only complete cycles of $20$, and the answer is $\frac {12}{20}\cdot1000 = \boxed{600}$.
Solution 4

Imagine that we increase $x$ from $0$ to $1$. At the beginning, the value of our expression is $0$, at the end it is $2+4+6+8=20$. How many integers between $1$ and $20$ did we skip? We skip some integers precisely at those points where at least two of $2x$, $4x$, $6x$, and $8x$ become integers at the same time.

Obviously, for $x=1/2$ and $x=1$ all four values become integers at the same time, hence we skip three integers at each of these locations. Additionally, for $x=1/4$ and $x=3/4$ the values $4x$ and $8x$ become integers at the same time, hence we skip one integer at each of the locations.

Therefore for $x\in(0,1]$ we skip a total of $3+3+1+1=8$ integers. As in Solution 2, we conclude that we hit $12$ of the integers from $1$ to $20$, and so we hit $50 \cdot 12 = 600$ of the first $1000$.

## 1985 AIME Problem 11

An ellipse has foci at $(9,20)$ and $(49,55)$ in the $xy$-plane and is tangent to the $x$-axis. What is the length of its major axis?
Solution

An ellipse is defined to be the locus of points $P$ such that the sum of the distances between $P$ and the two foci is constant. Let $F_1 = (9, 20)$, $F_2 = (49, 55)$ and $X = (x, 0)$ be the point of tangency of the ellipse with the $x$-axis. Then $X$ must be the point on the axis such that the sum $F_1X + F_2X$ is minimal. Finding the optimal location for $X$ is a classic problem: for any path from $F_1$ to $X$ and then back to $F_2$, we can reflect the second leg of this path (from $X$ to $F_2$) across the $x$-axis. Then our path connects $F_1$ to the reflection $F_2'$ of $F_2$ via some point on the $x$-axis, and this path will have shortest length exactly when our original path has shortest length. This occurs exactly when we have a straight-line path.

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/e/1/7/e17edad4abef8ffedba4e8086dacea0dc6c8c309.png" height="200px" /></div>

The sum of the two distances $F_1 X$ and $F_2X$ is therefore equal to the length of the segment $F_1F_2'$, which by the distance formula is just $d = \sqrt{(9 - 49)^2 + (20 + 55)^2} = \sqrt{40^2 + 75^2} = 5\sqrt{8^2 + 15^2} = 5\cdot 17 = 85$.

Finally, let $A$ and $B$ be the two endpoints of the major axis of the ellipse. Then by symmetry $AF_1 = F_2B$ so $AB = AF_1 + F_1B = F_2B + F_1B = d$ (because $B$ is on the ellipse), so the answer is $\boxed{085}$.


## 1985 AIME Problem 12

Let $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ be the vertices of a regular tetrahedron each of whose edges measures 1 meter. A bug, starting from vertex $A$, observes the following rule: at each vertex it chooses one of the three edges meeting at that vertex, each edge being equally likely to be chosen, and crawls along that edge to the vertex at its opposite end. Let $p = \frac n{729}$ be the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ when it has crawled exactly 7 meters. Find the value of $n$.

Solution
Solution 1

Let $P(n)$ denote the probability that the bug is at $A$ after it has crawled $n$ meters. Since the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a vertex which is not $A$, we have $P(n + 1) = \frac13 (1 - P(n))$. We also know $P(0) = 1$, so we can quickly compute $P(1)=0$, $P(2) = \frac 13$, $P(3) = \frac29$, $P(4) = \frac7{27}$, $P(5) = \frac{20}{81}$, $P(6) = \frac{61}{243}$ and $P(7) = \frac{182}{729}$, so the answer is $\boxed{182}$. One can solve this recursion fairly easily to determine a closed-form expression for $P(n)$.
Solution 2

We can find the number of different times the bug reaches vertex $A$ before the 7th move, and use these smaller cycles to calculate the number of different ways the bug can end up back at $A$.

Define $f(x)$ to be the number of paths of length $x$ which start and end at $A$ but do not pass through $A$ otherwise. Obviously $f(1) = 0$. In general for $f(x)$, the bug has three initial edges to pick from. From there, since the bug cannot return to $A$ by definition, the bug has exactly two choices. This continues from the 2nd move up to the $(x-1)$th move. The last move must be a return to $A$, so this move is determined. So $f(x) = 2^{x-2}3$.

Now we need to find the number of cycles by which the bug can reach $A$ at the end. Since $f(1) = 0$, $f(6)$ cannot be used since on the 7th move the bug cannot move from $A$ to $A$. So we need to find the number of partitions of 7 using only 2,3,4,5, and 7. These are $f(2)f(2)f(3)$, $f(2)f(5)$, $f(3)f(4)$, and $f(7)$. We can calculate these and sum them up using our formula. Also, order matters, so we need to find the number of ways to arrange each partition.
${3\choose1}f(2)f(2)f(3) + {2\choose1}f(2)f(5) + {2\choose1}f(3)f(4) + f(7)$
$= 3(3)(3)(2\cdot3) + 2(3)(2^33) + 2(2\cdot3)(2^23) + (2^53)$
$= 546$

Finally, this is a probability question, so we divide by $3^7$: $\frac{546}{3^7} = \frac{182}{3^6}$.
Solution 3

There exists a simple heuristic method to arrive at the answer to this question, due to Simon Rubinstein-Salzedo, as follows: after a couple of moves, the randomness of movement of the bug and smallness of the system ensures that we should expect its probability distribution to be very close to uniform. In particular, we would expect $P(n)$ to be very close to $\frac 14$ for decently-sized $n$, for example $n = 7$. (In fact, from looking at the previous solution we can see that it is already close when $n = 3$, and in fact the earlier values are also the best possible approximations given the restraints on where the bug can be.) Since we know the answer is of the form $\frac n{729}$, we realize that $n$ must be very close to $\frac{729}{4} = 182.25$, as indeed it is.

## 1985 AIME Problem 13


The numbers in the sequence $\displaystyle 101$, $\displaystyle 104$, $\displaystyle 109$, $\displaystyle 116$,$\displaystyle \ldots$ are of the form $\displaystyle a_n=100+n^2$, where $\displaystyle n=1,2,3,\ldots$ For each $\displaystyle n$, let $\displaystyle d_n$ be the greatest common divisor of $\displaystyle a_n$ and $\displaystyle a_{n+1}$. Find the maximum value of $\displaystyle d_n$ as $\displaystyle n$ ranges through the positive integers.
Solution 1

If $(x,y)$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$, then we have $d_n=(a_n,a_{n+1})=(100+n^2,100+n^2+2n+1)$. Now assuming that $d_n$ divides $100+n^2$, it must divide $2n+1$ if it is going to divide the entire expression $100+n^2+2n+1$.

Thus the equation turns into $d_n=(100+n^2,2n+1)$. Now note that since $2n+1$ is odd for integral $n$, we can multiply the left integer, $100+n^2$, by a multiple of two without affecting the greatest common divisor. Since the $n^2$ term is quite restrictive, let's multiply by $4$ so that we can get a $(2n+1)^2$ in there.

So $d_n=(4n^2+400,2n+1)=((2n+1)^2-4n+399,2n+1)=(-4n+399,2n+1)$. It simplified the way we wanted it to! Now using similar techniques we can write $d_n=(-2(2n+1)+401,2n+1)=(401,2n+1)$. Thus $d_n$ must divide $\boxed{401}$ for every single $n$. This means the largest possible value for $d_n$ is $401$, and we see that it can be achieved when $n = 200$.
Solution 2

We know that $a_n = 100+n^2$ and $a_{n+1} = 100+(n+1)^2 = 100+ n^2+2n+1$. Since we want to find the GCD of $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:

$a_{n+1}-a_n = 2n+1$


Now, the question is to find the GCD of $2n+1$ and $100+n^2$. We subtract $2n+1$ 100 times from $100+n^2$. This leaves us with $n^2-200n$. We want this to equal 0, so solving for $n$ gives us $n=200$. The last remainder is 0, thus $200*2+1 = \boxed{401}$ is our GCD.
Solution 3

If solution 2 is not entirely obvious, our answer is the max possible range of $\frac{x(x-200)}{2x+1}$. Using the euclidean algorithm on $x$ and $2x+1$ yields that they are relatively prime. Thus, the only way the gcd will not be 1 is if the$x-200$ term share factors with the $2x+1$. Using the euclidean algorithm, $gcd(x-200,2x+1)=gcd(x-22,2x+1-2(x-200))=gcd(x-200,401)$. Thus, the max gcd is 401.


## 1985 AIME Problem 14

In a tournament each player played exactly one game against each of the other players. In each game the winner was awarded $1$ point, the loser got $0$ points, and each of the two players earned $\frac{1}{2}$ point if the game was a tie. After the completion of the tournament, it was found that exactly half of the points earned by each player were earned against the ten players with the least number of points. (In particular, each of the ten lowest scoring players earned half of her/his points against the other nine of the ten). What was the total number of players in the tournament?
Solution

Let us suppose for convenience that there were $n + 10$ players over all. Among the $n$ players not in the weakest 10 there were $n \choose 2$ games played and thus $n \choose 2$ points earned. By the givens, this means that these $n$ players also earned $n \choose 2$ points against our weakest 10. Now, the 10 weakest players playing amongst themselves played ${10 \choose 2} = 45$ games and so earned 45 points playing each other. Then they also earned 45 points playing against the stronger $n$ players. Since every point earned falls into one of these categories, It follows that the total number of points earned was $2{n \choose 2} + 90 = n^2 - n + 90$. However, there was one point earned per game, and there were a total of ${n + 10 \choose 2} = \frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ games played and thus $\frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ points earned. So we have $n^2 -n + 90 = \frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ so $2n^2 - 2n + 180 = n^2 + 19n + 90$ and $n^2 -21n + 90 = 0$ and $n = 6$ or $n = 15$. Now, note that the top $n$ players got $n(n - 1)$ points in total (by our previous calculation) for an average of $n - 1$, while the bottom 10 got 90 points total, for an average of 9. Thus we must have $n > 10$, so $n = 15$ and the answer is $15 + 10 = \boxed{025}$.

Three 12 cm $\times$12 cm squares are each cut into two pieces $A$ and $B$, as shown in the first figure below, by joining the midpoints of two adjacent sides. These six pieces are then attached to a regular hexagon, as shown in the second figure, so as to fold into a polyhedron. What is the volume (in $\mathrm{cm}^3$) of this polyhedron?

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/f/ff/AIME_1985_Problem_15.png" height="150px" /></div>

Solution

Note that gluing two of the given polyhedra together along a hexagonal face (rotated $60^\circ$ from each other) yields a cube, so the volume is $\frac12 \cdot 12^3 = 864$.

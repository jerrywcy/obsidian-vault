## 1993 AIME Problem 1

How many even integers between 4000 and 7000 have four different digits?
Solution

The thousands digit is $\in \{4,5,6\}$. If the thousands digit is even ($4,\ 6$, 2 possibilities), then there are only $\frac{10}{2} - 1 = 4$ possibilities for the units digit. This leaves $8$ possible digits for the hundreds and $7$ for the tens places, yielding a total of $2 \cdot 4 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 = 448$.

If the thousands digit is odd ($5$, one possibility), then there are $5$ choices for the units digit, with $8$ digits for the hundreds and $7$ for the tens place. This gives $1 \cdot 5 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 = 280$ possibilities. Together, the solution is $448 + 280 = \boxed{728}$.


## 1993 AIME Problem 2

During a recent campaign for office, a candidate made a tour of a country which we assume lies in a plane. On the first day of the tour he went east, on the second day he went north, on the third day west, on the fourth day south, on the fifth day east, etc. If the candidate went $n^{2}_{}/2$ miles on the $n^{\mbox{th}}_{}$ day of this tour, how many miles was he from his starting point at the end of the $40^{\mbox{th}}_{}$ day?
Solution

On the first day, the candidate moves $[4(0) + 1]^2/2\ \text{east},\, [4(0) + 2]^2/2\ \text{north},\, [4(0) + 3]^2/2\ \text{west},\, [4(0) + 4]^2/2\ \text{south}$, and so on. The E/W displacement is thus $1^2 - 3^2 + 5^2 \ldots +37^2 - 39^2 = \left|\sum_{i=0}^9 \frac{(4i+1)^2}{2} - \sum_{i=0}^9 \frac{(4i+3)^2}{2}\right|$. Applying difference of squares, we see that 

$\begin{align*} \left|\sum_{i=0}^9 \frac{(4i+1)^2 - (4i+3)^2}{2}\right| &= \left|\sum_{i=0}^9 \frac{(4i+1+4i+3)(4i+1-(4i+3))}{2}\right|\\ &= \left|\sum_{i=0}^9 -(8i+4) \right|. \end{align*}$ 

The N/S displacement is $\left|\sum_{i=0}^9 \frac{(4i+2)^2}{2} - \sum_{i=0}^9 \frac{(4i+4)^2}{2}\right| = \left|\sum_{i=0}^9 -(8i+6) \right|.$ Since $\sum_{i=0}^{9} i = \frac{9(10)}{2} = 45$, the two distances evaluate to $8(45) + 10\cdot 4 = 400$ and $8(45) + 10\cdot 6 = 420$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the answer is $\sqrt{400^2 + 420^2} = 29 \cdot 20 = \boxed{580}$.


## 1993 AIME Problem 3

The table below displays some of the results of last summer's Frostbite Falls Fishing Festival, showing how many contestants caught $n\,$ fish for various values of $n\,$.
$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline n & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & \dots & 13 & 14 & 15 \\ \hline \text{number of contestants who caught} \ n \ \text{fish} & 9 & 5 & 7 & 23 & \dots & 5 & 2 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}$

In the newspaper story covering the event, it was reported that

(a) the winner caught $15$ fish; 
(b) those who caught $3$ or more fish averaged $6$ fish each; 
(c) those who caught $12$ or fewer fish averaged $5$ fish each. 

What was the total number of fish caught during the festival?
Solution
Suppose that the number of fish is $x$ and the number of contestants is $y$. The $y-21$ fishers that caught 3 or more fish caught a total of $x - \left(0(9) + 1(5) + 2(7)\right) = x - 19$ fish. Since they averaged 6 fish,
$6 = \frac{x - 19}{y - 21} \Longrightarrow x - 19 = 6y - 126.$
Similarily, those whom caught 12 or fewer fish averaged 5 fish per person, so
$5 = \frac{x - (13(5) + 14(2) + 15(1))}{y - 8} = \frac{x - 108}{y - 8} \Longrightarrow x - 108 = 5y - 40.$
Solving the two equation system, we find that $y = 175$ and $x = \boxed{943}$, the answer.


## 1993 AIME Problem 4

How many ordered four-tuples of integers $(a,b,c,d)\,$ with $0 < a < b < c < d < 500\,$ satisfy $a + d = b + c\,$ and $bc - ad = 93\,$?

Solution
Solution 1

Let $k = a + d = b + c$ so $d = k-a, b=k-c$. It follows that $(k-c)c - a(k-a) = (a-c)(a+c-k) = (c-a)(d-c) = 93$. Hence $(c - a,d - c) = (1,93),(3,31),(31,3),(93,1)$.

Solve them in tems of $c$ to get $(a,b,c,d) = (c - 93,c - 92,c,c + 1),$ $(c - 31,c - 28,c,c + 3),$ $(c - 1,c + 92,c,c + 93),$ $(c - 3,c + 28,c,c + 31)$. The last two solutions don't follow $a < b < c < d$, so we only need to consider the first two solutions.

The first solution gives us $c - 93\geq 1$ and $c + 1\leq 499$ $\implies 94\leq c\leq 498$, and the second one gives us $32\leq c\leq 496$.

So the total number of such four-tuples is $405 + 465 = \boxed{870}$.
Solution 2

Let $b = a + m$ and $c = a + m + n$. From $a + d = b + c$, $d = b + c - a = a + 2m + n$.

Substituting $b = a + m$, $c = a + m + n$, and $d = b + c - a = a + 2m + n$ into $bc - ad = 93$, $bc - ad = (1 + m)(1 + m + n) - a(a + 2m + n) = m(m + n). = 93 = 3(31)$ Hence, $(m,n) = (1,92)$ or $(3,28)$.

For $(m,n) = (1,92)$, we know that $0 < a < a + 1 < a + 93 < a + 94 < 500$, so there are $405$ four-tuples. For $(m,n) = (3,28)$, $0 < a < a + 3 < a + 31 < a + 34 < 500$, and there are $465$ four-tuples. In total, we have $405 + 465 = \boxed{870}$ four-tuples.
Solution 3

Square both sides of the first equation in order to get $bc$ and $ad$ terms, which we can plug $93$ in for.

$(a+d)^2 = (b+c)^2 \\ \implies a^2 + 2ad + d^2 = b^2 + 2bc + c^2 \\ \implies 2bc-2ad = a^2-b^2 + d^2-c^2 \\ \implies 2(bc-ad) = (a-b)(a+b)+(d-c)(d+c)$

We can plug $93$ in for $bc - ad$ to get $186$ on the left side, and also observe that $a-b = c-d$ after rearranging the first equation. Plug in $c-d$ for $a-b$.

$186 = (c-d)(a+b) + (d-c)(d+c) \\ \implies 186 = -(d-c)(a+b) + (d-c)(d+c) \\ \implies 186 = (d-c)(d+c-a-b)$

Now observe the possible factors of $186$, which are $1 \cdot 186, 2\cdot 93, 3 \cdot 62, 6\cdot 31$. $(d-c)$ and $(d+c-a-b)$ must be factors of $186$, and $(d+c-a-b)$ must be greater than $(d-c)$.

$1 \cdot 186$ work, and yields $405$ possible solutions. $2 \cdot 93$ does not work, because if $c-d = 2$, then $a+b$ must differ by 2 as well, but an odd number $93$ can only result from two numbers of different parity. $c-d$ will be even, and $a+b$ will be even, so $c+d - (a+b)$ must be even. $3 \cdot 62$ works, and yields $465$ possible solutions, while $6 \cdot 31$ fails for the same reasoning above.

Thus, the answer is $405 + 465 = \boxed{870}$


## 1993 AIME Problem 5

Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$. For integers $n \ge 1\,$, define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$. What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$?
Solution

Notice that 

$\begin{align*}P_{20}(x) &= P_{19}(x - 20)\\ &= P_{18}((x - 20) - 19)\\ &= P_{17}(((x - 20) - 19) - 18)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= P_0(x - (20 + 19 + 18 + \ldots + 2 + 1)).\end{align*}$


Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ numbers, $1 + 2 + \cdots + 20 = \frac{20(20+1)}{2} = 210$. Therefore, $P_{20}(x) = P_0(x - 210).$

Substituting $x - 210$ into the function definition, we get $P_0(x-210) = (x - 210)^3 + 313(x - 210)^2 - 77(x - 210) - 8$. We only need the coefficients of the linear terms, which we can find by the binomial theorem.

$(x-210)^3$ will have a linear term of ${3\choose1}210^2x = 630 \cdot 210x$.
$313(x-210)^2$ will have a linear term of $-313 \cdot {2\choose1}210x = -626 \cdot 210x$.
$-77(x-210)$ will have a linear term of $-77x$. 

Adding up the coefficients, we get $630 \cdot 210 - 626 \cdot 210 - 77 = \boxed{763}$.


## 1993 AIME Problem 6


What is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of nine consecutive integers, the sum of ten consecutive integers, and the sum of eleven consecutive integers?
Solution
Solution 1

Denote the first of each of the series of consecutive integers as $a,\ b,\ c$. Therefore, $n = a + (a + 1) \ldots (a + 8) = 9a + 36 = 10b + 45 = 11c + 55$. Simplifying, $9a = 10b + 9 = 11c + 19$. The relationship between $a,\ b$ suggests that $b$ is divisible by $9$. Also, $10b -10 = 10(b-1) = 11c$, so $b-1$ is divisible by $11$. We find that the least possible value of $b = 45$, so the answer is $10(45) + 45 = 495$.
Solution 2

Let the desired integer be $n$. From the information given, it can be determined that, for positive integers $a, \ b, \ c$:

$n = 9a + 36 = 10b + 45 = 11c + 55$

This can be rewritten as the following congruences:

$n \equiv 0 \mod{9}$

$n \equiv 5 \mod{10}$

$n \equiv 0 \mod{11}$

Since 9 and 11 are relatively prime, n is a multiple of 99. It can then easily be determined that the smallest multiple of 99 with a units digit 5 (this can be interpreted from the 2nd congruence) is $\boxed{495}$
Solution 3

Let $n$ be the desired integer. From the given information, we have $\begin{align*}9x &= a \\ 11y &= a \\ 10z + 5 &= a, \end{align*}$ here, $x,$ and $y$ are the middle terms of the sequence of 9 and 11 numbers, respectively. Similarly, we have $z$ as the 4th term of the sequence. Since, $a$ is a multiple of $9$ and $11,$ it is also a multiple of $\text{lcm}[9,11]=99.$ Hence, $a=99m,$ for some $m.$ So, we have $10z + 5 = 99m.$ It follows that $99(5) = \boxed{495}$ is the smallest integer that can be represented in such a way.


## 1993 AIME Problem 7


Three numbers, $a_1\,$, $a_2\,$, $a_3\,$, are drawn randomly and without replacement from the set $\{1, 2, 3, \dots, 1000\}\,$. Three other numbers, $b_1\,$, $b_2\,$, $b_3\,$, are then drawn randomly and without replacement from the remaining set of 997 numbers. Let $p\,$ be the probability that, after a suitable rotation, a brick of dimensions $a_1 \times a_2 \times a_3\,$ can be enclosed in a box of dimensions $b_1 \times b_2 \times b_3\,$, with the sides of the brick parallel to the sides of the box. If $p\,$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?
Solution 1

Call the six numbers selected $x_1 > x_2 > x_3 > x_4 > x_5 > x_6$. Clearly, $x_1$ must be a dimension of the box, and $x_6$ must be a dimension of the brick.

If $x_2$ is a dimension of the box, then any of the other three remaining dimensions will work as a dimension of the box. That gives us $3$ possibilities.
If $x_2$ is not a dimension of the box but $x_3$ is, then both remaining dimensions will work as a dimension of the box. That gives us $2$ possibilities.
If $x_4$ is a dimension of the box but $x_2,\ x_3$ arenâ€™t, there are no possibilities (same for $x_5$). 

The total number of arrangements is ${6\choose3} = 20$; therefore, $p = \frac{3 + 2}{20} = \frac{1}{4}$, and the answer is $1 + 4 = \boxed{005}$.

Note that the $1000$ in the problem, is not used, and is cleverly bypassed in the solution, because we can call our six numbers $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5,x_6$ whether they may be $1,2,3,4,5,6$ or $999,5,3,998,997,891$.
Solution 2

Like $solution$ $1$, call the six numbers selected $x_1 > x_2 > x_3 > x_4 > x_5 > x_6$. Using the hook-length formula, the number of valid configuration is $\frac{6!}{4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot3\cdot2}$. This gives us $5$, and we proceed as $solution$ $1$ did.


## 1993 AIME Problem 8


Let $S\,$ be a set with six elements. In how many different ways can one select two not necessarily distinct subsets of $S\,$ so that the union of the two subsets is $S\,$? The order of selection does not matter; for example, the pair of subsets $\{a, c\}\,$, $\{b, c, d, e, f\}\,$ represents the same selection as the pair $\{b, c, d, e, f\}\,$, $\{a, c\}\,$.
Solution 1

Call the two subsets $m$ and $n$. For each of the elements in $S$, we can assign it to either $m$, $n$, or both. This gives us $3^6$ possible methods of selection. However, because the order of the subsets does not matter, each possible selection is double counted, except the case where both $m$ and $n$ contain all $6$ elements of $S$. So our final answer is then $\frac {3^6 - 1}{2} + 1 = \boxed{365}$
Solution 2

Given one of ${6 \choose k}$ subsets with $k$ elements, the other also has $2^k$ possibilities; this is because it must contain all of the "missing" $n - k$ elements and thus has a choice over the remaining $k$. We want $\sum_{k = 0}^6 {6 \choose k}2^k = (2 + 1)^6 = 729$ by Binomial Theorem. But the order of the sets doesn't matter, so we get $\frac{729 - 1}{2} + 1 = \boxed{365}$.


## 1993 AIME Problem 9

Two thousand points are given on a circle. Label one of the points $1$. From this point, count $2$ points in the clockwise direction and label this point $2$. From the point labeled $2$, count $3$ points in the clockwise direction and label this point $3$. (See figure.) Continue this process until the labels $1,2,3\dots,1993\,$ are all used. Some of the points on the circle will have more than one label and some points will not have a label. What is the smallest integer that labels the same point as $1993$?

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/3/39/AIME_1993_Problem_9.png" height="20px" /></div>

Solution

The label $1993$ will occur on the $\frac12(1993)(1994) \mod{2000}$th point around the circle. (Starting from 1) A number $n$ will only occupy the same point on the circle if $\frac12(n)(n + 1)\equiv \frac12(1993)(1994) \mod{2000}$.

Simplifying this expression, we see that $(1993)(1994) - (n)(n + 1) = (1993 - n)(1994 + n)\equiv 0\mod{2000}$. Therefore, one of $1993 - n$ or $1994 + n$ is odd, and each of them must be a multiple of $125$ or $16$.

For $1993 - n$ to be a multiple of $125$ and $1994 + n$ to be a multiple of $16$, $n \equiv 118 \mod {125}$ and $n\equiv 6 \mod {16}$. The smallest $n$ for this case is $118$.

In order for $1993 - n$ to be a multiple of $16$ and $1994 + n$ to be a multiple of $125$, $n\equiv 9\mod{16}$ and $n\equiv 6\mod{125}$. The smallest $n$ for this case is larger than $118$, so $\boxed{118}$ is our answer.

Note: One can just substitute $1993\equiv-7\mod{2000}$ and $1994\equiv-6\mod{2000}$ to simplify calculations.


## 1993 AIME Problem 10


Euler's formula states that for a convex polyhedron with $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces, $V-E+F=2$. A particular convex polyhedron has 32 faces, each of which is either a triangle or a pentagon. At each of its $V$ vertices, $T$ triangular faces and $P$ pentagonal faces meet. What is the value of $100P+10T+V$?
Solution
Solution 1

The convex polyhedron of the problem can be easily visualized; it corresponds to a dodecahedron (a regular solid with $12$ equilateral pentagons) in which the $20$ vertices have all been truncated to form $20$ equilateral triangles with common vertices. The resulting solid has then $p=12$ smaller equilateral pentagons and $t=20$ equilateral triangles yielding a total of $t+p=F=32$ faces. In each vertex, $T=2$ triangles and $P=2$ pentagons are concurrent. Now, the number of edges $E$ can be obtained if we count the number of sides that each triangle and pentagon contributes: $E=\frac{3t+5p}{2}$, (the factor $2$ in the denominator is because we are counting twice each edge, since two adjacent faces share one edge). Thus, $E=60$. Finally, using Euler's formula we have $V=E-30=30$.

In summary, the solution to the problem is $100P+10T+V=\boxed{250}$.
Solution 2

As seen above, $E=V+30$. Every vertex $V$, there is a triangle for every $T$ and a pentagon for every $P$ by the given. However, there are three times every triangle will be counted and five times every pentagon will be counted because of their numbers of vertices. From this observation, $\frac{VT}3+\frac{VP}5=32\implies V(5T+3P)=480$. Also, at every vertex $V$, there are $T+P$ edges coming out from that vertex (one way to see this is to imagine the leftmost segment of each triangle and pentagon that is connected to the given vertex, and note that it includes every one of the edges exactly once), so $\frac{V(T+P)}2=E\implies V(T+P)=2E\implies V(5T+5P)=10E$, and subtracting the other equation involving the vertices from this gives $2VP=10E-480\implies VP=5E-240=5(V+30)-240=5V-90$ $\implies V(5-P)=90$. Since $V|480$ from the first vertex-related observation and $P>0\implies5-P<5$, and it quickly follows that $V=30\implies E=60\implies P=2\implies T=2\implies100P+10T+V=\boxed{250}$.


## 1993 AIME Problem 11

Alfred and Bonnie play a game in which they take turns tossing a fair coin. The winner of a game is the first person to obtain a head. Alfred and Bonnie play this game several times with the stipulation that the loser of a game goes first in the next game. Suppose that Alfred goes first in the first game, and that the probability that he wins the sixth game is $m/n\,$, where $m\,$ and $n\,$ are relatively prime positive integers. What are the last three digits of $m+n\,$?
Solution

The probability that the $n$th flip in each game occurs and is a head is $\frac{1}{2^n}$. The first person wins if the coin lands heads on an odd numbered flip. So, the probability of the first person winning the game is $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{32}+\cdots = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1-\frac{1}{4}}=\frac{2}{3}$, and the probability of the second person winning is $\frac{1}{3}$.

Let $a_n$ be the probability that Alfred wins the $n$th game, and let $b_n$ be the probability that Bonnie wins the $n$th game.

If Alfred wins the $n$th game, then the probability that Alfred wins the $n+1$th game is $\frac{1}{3}$. If Bonnie wins the $n$th game, then the probability that Alfred wins the $n+1$th game is $\frac{2}{3}$.

Thus, $a_{n+1}=\frac{1}{3}a_n+\frac{2}{3}b_n$.

Similarly, $b_{n+1}=\frac{2}{3}a_n+\frac{1}{3}b_n$.

Since Alfred goes first in the $1$st game, $(a_1,b_1)=\left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{3}\right)$.

Using these recursive equations:

$(a_2,b_2)=\left(\frac{4}{9}, \frac{5}{9}\right)$

$(a_3,b_3)=\left(\frac{14}{27}, \frac{13}{27}\right)$

$(a_4,b_4)=\left(\frac{40}{81}, \frac{41}{81}\right)$

$(a_5,b_5)=\left(\frac{122}{243}, \frac{121}{243}\right)$

$(a_6,b_6)=\left(\frac{364}{729}, \frac{365}{729}\right)$

Since $a_6=\frac{364}{729}$, $m+n = 1093 \equiv \boxed{093} \mod{1000}$.


## 1993 AIME Problem 12


The vertices of $\triangle ABC$ are $A = (0,0)\,$, $B = (0,420)\,$, and $C = (560,0)\,$. The six faces of a die are labeled with two $A\,$'s, two $B\,$'s, and two $C\,$'s. Point $P_1 = (k,m)\,$ is chosen in the interior of $\triangle ABC$, and points $P_2\,$, $P_3\,$, $P_4, \dots$ are generated by rolling the die repeatedly and applying the rule: If the die shows label $L\,$, where $L \in \{A, B, C\}$, and $P_n\,$ is the most recently obtained point, then $P_{n + 1}^{}$ is the midpoint of $\overline{P_n L}$. Given that $P_7 = (14,92)\,$, what is $k + m\,$?
Solution
Solution 1

If we have points (p,q) and (r,s) and we want to find (u,v) so (r,s) is the midpoint of (u,v) and (p,q), then u=2r-p and v=2s-q. So we start with the point they gave us and work backwards. We make sure all the coordinates stay within the triangle. We have: $P_7=(14,92) P_6=(2\cdot14-0, 2\cdot92-0)=(28,184) P_5=(2\cdot28-0, 2\cdot 184-0)=(56,368) P_4=(2\cdot56-0, 2\cdot368-420)=(112,316) P_3=(2\cdot112-0, 2\cdot316-420)=(224,212) P_2=(2\cdot224-0, 2\cdot212-420)=(448,4) P_1=(2\cdot448-560, 2\cdot4-0)=(336,8)$ So the answer is $\boxed{344}$.
Solution 2

Let $L_1$ be the $n^{th}$ roll that directly influences $P_{n + 1}$. Note that $P_7 = \cfrac{\cfrac{\cfrac{P_1 + L_1}2 + L_2}2 + \cdots}{2\ldots} = \frac {(k,m)}{64} + \frac {L_1}{64} + \frac {L_2}{32} + \frac {L_3}{16} + \frac {L_4}8 + \frac {L_5}4 + \frac {L_6}2 = (14,92)$. 

Then quickly checking each addend from the right to the left, we have the following information (remembering that if a point must be $(0,0)$, we can just ignore it!): for $\frac {L_6}2,\frac {L_5}4$, since all addends are nonnegative, a non-$(0,0)$ value will result in a $x$ or $y$ value greater than $14$ or $92$, respectively, and we can ignore them, for $\frac {L_4}8,\frac {L_3}{16},\frac {L_2}{32}$ in a similar way, $(0,0)$ and $(0,420)$ are the only possibilities, and for $\frac {L_1}{64}$, all three work. Also, to be in the triangle, $0\le k\le560$ and $0\le m\le420$. Since $L_1$ is the only point that can possibly influence the $x$ coordinate other than $P_1$, we look at that first. If $L_2 = (0,0)$, then $k = 2^6\cdot14 = 64\cdot14 > 40\cdot14 = 560$, so it can only be that $L_2 = (560,0)$, and $k + 560 = 2^6\cdot14\implies k = 64\cdot14 - 40\cdot14 = 24\cdot14 = 6\cdot56 = 336$. Now, considering the $y$ coordinate, note that if any of $L_3,L_4,L_5$ are $(0,0)$ ($L_3$ would influence the least, so we test that), then $\frac {L_3}{32} + \frac {L_4}{16} + \frac {L_5}8 < \frac {420}{16} + \frac {420}8 = 79\pm\epsilon < 80$, which would mean that $P_1 > 2^6\cdot(92 - 80) = 64\cdot12 > 42\cdot10 = 420\ge m$, so $L_3,L_4,L_5 = (0,420)$, and now $\frac {P_1}{64} + \frac {420}{2^5} + \frac {420}{2^4} + \frac {420}{2^3} = 92\implies P_1 = 64\cdot92 - 420(2 + 4 + 8) = 64\cdot92 - 420\cdot14$ $= 64(100 - 8) - 14^2\cdot30 = 6400 - 512 - (200 - 4)\cdot30 = 6400 - 512 - 6000 + 120$ $= - 112 + 120 = 8$, and finally, $k + m = 336 + 8 = \boxed{344}$.


## 1993 AIME Problem 13

Jenny and Kenny are walking in the same direction, Kenny at 3 feet per second and Jenny at 1 foot per second, on parallel paths that are 200 feet apart. A tall circular building 100 feet in diameter is centered midway between the paths. At the instant when the building first blocks the line of sight between Jenny and Kenny, they are 200 feet apart. Let $t\,$ be the amount of time, in seconds, before Jenny and Kenny can see each other again. If $t\,$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?

Solution
Solution 1

Consider the unit cicle of radius 50. Assume that they start at points $(-50,100)$ and $(-50,-100).$ Then at time $t$, they end up at points $(-50+t,100)$ and $(-50+3t,-100).$ The equation of the line connecting these points and the equation of the circle are $\begin{align}y&=-\frac{100}{t}x+200-\frac{5000}{t}\\50^2&=x^2+y^2\end{align}$. When they see each other again, the line connecting the two points will be tangent to the circle at the point $(x,y).$ Since the radius is perpendicular to the tangent we get $-\frac{x}{y}=-\frac{100}{t}$ or $xt=100y.$ Now substitute $y= \frac{xt}{100}$ into $(2)$ and get $x=\frac{5000}{\sqrt{100^2+t^2}}.$ Now substitute this and $y=\frac{xt}{100}$ into $(1)$ and solve for $t$ to get $t=\frac{160}{3}.$ Finally, the sum of the numerator and denominator is $160+3=\boxed{163}.$
Solution 2

Let $A$ and $B$ be Kenny's initial and final points respectively and define $C$ and $D$ similarly for Jenny. Let $O$ be the center of the building. Also, let $X$ be the intersection of $AC$ and $BD$. Finaly, let $P$ and $Q$ be the points of tangency of circle $O$ to $AC$ and $BD$ respectively.

From the problem statement, $AB=3t$, and $CD=t$. Since $\Delta ABX \sim \Delta CDX$, $CX=AC\cdot\left(\frac{CD}{AB-CD}\right)=200\cdot\left(\frac{t}{3t-t}\right)=100$.

Since $PC=100$, $PX=200$. So, $\tan(\angle OXP)=\frac{OP}{PX}=\frac{50}{200}=\frac{1}{4}$.

Since circle $O$ is tangent to $BX$ and $AX$, $OX$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BXA$.

Thus, $\tan(\angle BXA)=\tan(2\angle OXP)=\frac{2\tan(\angle OXP)}{1- \tan^2(\angle OXP)} = \frac{2\cdot \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}{1-\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2}=\frac{8}{15}$.

Therefore, $t = CD = CX\cdot\tan(\angle BXA) = 100 \cdot \frac{8}{15} = \frac{160}{3}$, and the answer is $\boxed{163}$.

Let $t$ be the time they walk. Then $CD=t$ and $AB=3t$.


Draw a line from point $O$ to $Q$ such that $OQ$ is perpendicular to $BD$. Further, draw a line passing through points $O$ and $P$, so $OP$ is parallel to $AB$ and $CD$ and is midway between those two lines. Then $PR=\frac{AB+CD}{2}=\frac{3t+t}{2}=2t$. Draw another line passing through point $D$ and parallel to $AC$, and call the point of intersection of this line with $AB$ as $S$. Then $SB=AB-AS=3t-t=2t$.


We see that $m\angle SBD=m\angle ORQ$ since they are corresponding angles, and thus by angle-angle similarity, $\triangle QOR\sim\triangle SDB$.


Then $\begin{align*} \frac{OQ}{DS}=\frac{RO}{BD}&\implies\frac{50}{200}=\frac{RO}{\sqrt{200^2+4t^2}}\\ &\implies RO=\frac{1}{4}\left(\sqrt{200^2+4t^2}\right)\\ &\implies RO=\frac{1}{2}\left(\sqrt{100^2+t^2}\right) \end{align*}$


And we obtain $\begin{align*} PR-OP&=RO\\ 2t-50&=\frac{1}{2}\left(\sqrt{100^2+t^2}\right)\\ 4t-100&=\sqrt{100^2+t^2}\\ (4t-100)^2&=\left(\sqrt{100^2+t^2}\right)^2\\ 16t^2-800t+100^2&=t^2+100^2\\ 15t^2&=800t\\ t&=\frac{800}{15} \end{align*}$

so we have $t=\frac{160}{3}$, and our answer is thus $160+3=\boxed{163}$.


## 1993 AIME Problem 14


A rectangle that is inscribed in a larger rectangle (with one vertex on each side) is called unstuck if it is possible to rotate (however slightly) the smaller rectangle about its center within the confines of the larger. Of all the rectangles that can be inscribed unstuck in a 6 by 8 rectangle, the smallest perimeter has the form $\sqrt{N}\,$, for a positive integer $N\,$. Find $N\,$.
Solution

Answer: 448.

Solution: Put the rectangle on the coordinate plane so its vertices are at $(\pm4,\pm3)$, for all four combinations of positive and negative. Then by symmetry, the other rectangle is also centered at the origin, $O$.

Note that such a rectangle is unstuck if its four vertices are in or on the edge of all four quadrants, and it is not the same rectangle as the big one. Let the four vertices of this rectangle be $A(4,y)$, $B(-x,3)$, $C(-4,-y)$ and $D(x,-3)$ for nonnegative $x,y$. Then this is a rectangle, so $OA=OB$, or $16+y^2=9+x^2$, so $x^2=y^2+7$.

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/b/b0/1993_AIME_14_Diagram.png" height="100px" /></div>

Reflect $D$ across the side of the rectangle containing $C$ to $D'(-8-x,-3)$. Then $BD'=\sqrt{(-8-x-(-x))^2+(3-(-3))^2}=10$ is constant, and the perimeter of the rectangle is equal to $2(BC+CD')$. The midpoint of $\overline{BD'}$ is $(-4-x,0)$, and since $-4>-4-x$ and $-y\le0$, $C$ always lies below $\overline{BD'}$.

If $y$ is positive, it can be decreased to $y'<y$. This causes $x$ to decrease as well, to $x'$, where $x'^2=y'^2+7$ and $x'$ is still positive. If $B$ and $D'$ are held in place as everything else moves, then $C$ moves $(y-y')$ units up and $(x-x')$ units left to $C'$, which must lie within $\triangle BCD'$. Then we must have $BC'+C'D'<BC+CD'$, and the perimeter of the rectangle is decreased. Therefore, the minimum perimeter must occur with $y=0$, so $x=\sqrt7$.

By the distance formula, this minimum perimeter is $2\left(\sqrt{(4-\sqrt7)^2+3^2}+\sqrt{(4+\sqrt7)^2+3^2}\right)=4\left(\sqrt{8-2\sqrt7}+\sqrt{8+2\sqrt7}\right)$ $=4(\sqrt7-1+\sqrt7+1)=8\sqrt7=\sqrt{448}.$
Solution 2

Note that the diagonal of the rectangle with minimum perimeter must have the diagonal along the middle segment of length 8 of the rectangle (any other inscribed rectangle can be rotated a bit, then made smaller; this one can't because then the rectangle cannot be inscribed since its longest diagonal is less than 8 in length). Then since a rectangle must have right angles, we draw a circle of radius 4 around the center of the rectangle. Picking the two midpoints on the sides of length 6 and opposite intersection points on the segments of length 8, we form a rectangle. Let $a$ and $b$ be the sides of the rectangle. Then $ab = 3(8) = 24$ since both are twice the area of the same right triangle, and $a^2+b^2 = 64$. So $(a+b)^2 = 64+2(24) = 112$, so $2(a+b) = \boxed{\sqrt{448}}$.

Let $\overline{CH}$ be an altitude of $\triangle ABC$. Let $R\,$ and $S\,$ be the points where the circles inscribed in the triangles $ACH\,$ and $BCH^{}_{}$ are tangent to $\overline{CH}$. If $AB = 1995\,$, $AC = 1994\,$, and $BC = 1993\,$, then $RS\,$ can be expressed as $m/n\,$, where $m\,$ and $n\,$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n\,$.
Solution

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/b/8/b/b8b732c641481c3b1635527f52f3125316ac3f3d.png" height="150px" /></div>

From the Pythagorean Theorem, $AH^2+CH^2=1994^2$, and $(1995-AH)^2+CH^2=1993^2$. Subtracting those two equations yields $AH^2-(1995-AH)^2=3987$. After simplification, we see that $2*1995AH-1995^2=3987$, or $AH=\frac{1995}{2}+\frac{3987}{2*1995}$. Note that $AH+BH=1995$. Therefore we have that $BH=\frac{1995}{2}-\frac{3987}{2*1995}$. Therefore $AH-BH=\frac{3987}{1995}$.

Now note that $RS=|HR-HS|$, $RH=\frac{AH+CH-AC}{2}$, and $HS=\frac{CH+BH-BC}{2}$. Therefore we have

$RS=\left| \frac{AH+CH-AC-CH-BH+BC}{2} \right|=\frac{|AH-BH-1994+1993|}{2}$.

Plugging in $AH-BH$ and simplifying, we have $RS=\frac{1992}{1995*2}=\frac{332}{665} \rightarrow 332+665=\boxed{997}$.

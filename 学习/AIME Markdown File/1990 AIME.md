## 1990 AIME Problem 1

The increasing sequence $2,3,5,6,7,10,11,\ldots$ consists of all positive integers that are neither the square nor the cube of a positive integer. Find the 500th term of this sequence.
Solution

Because there aren't that many perfect squares or cubes, let's look for the smallest perfect square greater than $500$. This happens to be $23^2=529$. Notice that there are $23$ squares and $8$ cubes less than or equal to $529$, but $1$ and $2^6$ are both squares and cubes. Thus, there are $529-23-8+2=500$ numbers in our sequence less than $529$. Magically, we want the $500th$ term, so our answer is the smallest non-square and non-cube less than $529$, which is $\boxed{528}$.


## 1990 AIME Problem 2

Find the value of $(52+6\sqrt{43})^{3/2}-(52-6\sqrt{43})^{3/2}$.
Solution

Suppose that $52+6\sqrt{43}$ is in the form of $(a + b\sqrt{43})^2$. FOILing yields that $52 + 6\sqrt{43} = a^2 + 43b^2 + 2ab\sqrt{43}$. This implies that $a$ and $b$ equal one of $\pm1, \pm3$. The possible sets are $(3,1)$ and $(-3,-1)$; the latter can be discarded since the square root must be positive. This means that $52 + 6\sqrt{43} = (\sqrt{43} + 3)^2$. Repeating this for $52-6\sqrt{43}$, the only feasible possibility is $(\sqrt{43} - 3)^2$.

Rewriting, we get $(\sqrt{43} + 3)^3 - (\sqrt{43} - 3)^3$. Using the difference of cubes, we get that $[\sqrt{43} + 3\ - \sqrt{43} + 3]\ [(43 + 6\sqrt{43} + 9) + (43 - 9) + (43 - 6\sqrt{43} + 9)]$ $= (6)(3 \cdot 43 + 9) = \boxed{828}$.


## 1990 AIME Problem 3

Let $P_1^{}$ be a regular $r~\mbox{gon}$ and $P_2^{}$ be a regular $s~\mbox{gon}$ $(r\geq s\geq 3)$ such that each interior angle of $P_1^{}$ is $\frac{59}{58}$ as large as each interior angle of $P_2^{}$. What's the largest possible value of $s$?
Solution

The formula for the interior angle of a regular sided polygon is $\frac{(n-2)180}{n}$.

Thus, $\frac{\frac{(r-2)180}{r}}{\frac{(s-2)180}{s}} = \frac{59}{58}$. Cross multiplying and simplifying, we get $\frac{58(r-2)}{r} = \frac{59(s-2)}{s}$. Cross multiply and combine like terms again to yield $58rs - 58 \cdot 2s = 59rs - 59 \cdot 2r \Longrightarrow 118r - 116s = rs$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \frac{116s}{118 - s}$.

$r \ge 0$ and $s \ge 0$, making the numerator of the fraction positive. To make the denominator positive, $s < 118$; the largest possible value of $s$ is $117$.

This is achievable because the denominator is $1$, making $r$ a positive number $116 \cdot 117$ and $s = \boxed{117}$.


## 1990 AIME Problem 4

Find the positive solution to
$\frac 1{x^2-10x-29}+\frac1{x^2-10x-45}-\frac 2{x^2-10x-69}=0$
Solution

We could clear out the denominators by multiplying, though that would be unnecessarily tedious.

To simplify the equation, substitute $a = x^2 - 10x - 29$ (the denominator of the first fraction). We can rewrite the equation as $\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{a - 16} - \frac{2}{a - 40} = 0$. Multiplying out the denominators now, we get:

$(a - 16)(a - 40) + a(a - 40) - 2(a)(a - 16) = 0$

Simplifying, $-64a + 40 \times 16 = 0$, so $a = 10$. Re-substituting, $10 = x^2 - 10x - 29 \Longleftrightarrow 0 = (x - 13)(x + 3)$. The positive root is $\boxed{013}$.


## 1990 AIME Problem 5

Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of $75$ and has exactly $75$ positive integral divisors, including $1$ and itself. Find $\frac{n}{75}$.
Solution

The prime factorization of $75 = 3^15^2 = (2+1)(4+1)(4+1)$. For $n$ to have exactly $75$ integral divisors, we need to have $n = p_1^{e_1-1}p_2^{e_2-1}\cdots$ such that $e_1e_2 \cdots = 75$. Since $75|n$, two of the prime factors must be $3$ and $5$. To minimize $n$, we can introduce a third prime factor, $2$. Also to minimize $n$, we want $5$, the greatest of all the factors, to be raised to the least power. Therefore, $n = 2^43^45^2$ and $\frac{n}{75} = \frac{2^43^45^2}{3 \cdot 5^2} = 16 \cdot 27 = \boxed{432}$.


## 1990 AIME Problem 6

A biologist wants to calculate the number of fish in a lake. On May 1 she catches a random sample of 60 fish, tags them, and releases them. On September 1 she catches a random sample of 70 fish and finds that 3 of them are tagged. To calculate the number of fish in the lake on May 1, she assumes that 25% of these fish are no longer in the lake on September 1 (because of death and emigrations), that 40% of the fish were not in the lake May 1 (because of births and immigrations), and that the number of untagged fish and tagged fish in the September 1 sample are representative of the total population. What does the biologist calculate for the number of fish in the lake on May 1?
Solution

Of the $70$ fish caught in September, $40\%$ were not there in May, so $42$ fish were there in May. Since the percentage of tagged fish in September is proportional to the percentage of tagged fish in May, $\frac{3}{42} = \frac{60}{x} \Longrightarrow \boxed{x = 840}$.

(Note the 25% death rate does not affect the answer b/c both tagged and nontagged fish die.)


## 1990 AIME Problem 7

A triangle has vertices $P=(-8,5)$, $Q=(-15,-19)$, and $R=(1,-7)$. The equation of the bisector of $\angle P$ can be written in the form $ax+2y+c=0$. Find $a+c$.

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/b/7/6/b7650dc9ace1a94c8dc1634c4bfa218183f6602c.png" height="200px" /></div>

Solution 
Use the distance formula to determine the lengths of each of the sides of the triangle. We find that it has lengths of side $15,\ 20,\ 25$, indicating that it is a $3-4-5$ right triangle. At this point, we just need to find another point that lies on the bisector of $\angle P$.
Solution 1

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/e/5/1/e51a70bc1f21cb48775b66de3054d6f7622a3627.png" height="200px" /></div>

Use the angle bisector theorem to find that the angle bisector of $\angle P$ divides $QR$ into segments of length $\frac{25}{x} = \frac{15}{20 -x} \Longrightarrow x = \frac{25}{2},\ \frac{15}{2}$. It follows that $\frac{QP'}{RP'} = \frac{5}{3}$, and so $P' = \left(\frac{5x_R + 3x_Q}{8},\frac{5y_R + 3y_Q}{8}\right) = (-5,-23/2)$.

The desired answer is the equation of the line $PP'$. $PP'$ has slope $\frac{-11}{2}$, from which we find the equation to be $11x + 2y + 78 = 0$. Therefore, $a+c = \boxed{089}$.
Solution 2

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/8/6/786d51d5c72e94f0b159e6406b8cc29bbc70f311.png" height="200px" /></div>

Extend $PR$ to a point $S$ such that $PS = 25$. This forms an isosceles triangle $PQS$. The coordinates of $S$, using the slope of $PR$ (which is $-4/3$), can be determined to be $(7,-15)$. Since the angle bisector of $\angle P$ must touch the midpoint of $QS \Rightarrow (-4,-17)$, we have found our two points. We reach the same answer of $11x + 2y + 78 = 0$.
Solution 3

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/3/b/e/3be1357e127e0b9b6aeea9267697d70227e84c44.png" height="200px" /></div>

By the angle bisector theorem as in solution 1, we find that $QP' = 25/2$. If we draw the right triangle formed by $Q, P',$ and the point directly to the right of $Q$ and below $P'$, we get another $3-4-5 \triangle$ (since the slope of $QR$ is $3/4$). Using this, we find that the horizontal projection of $QP'$ is $10$ and the vertical projection of $QP'$ is $15/2$.

Thus, the angle bisector touches $QR$ at the point $\left(-15 + 10, -19 + \frac{15}{2}\right) = \left(-5,-\frac{23}{2}\right)$, from where we continue with the first solution.


## 1990 AIME Problem 8

In a shooting match, eight clay targets are arranged in two hanging columns of three targets each and one column of two targets. A marksman is to break all the targets according to the following rules:

1) The marksman first chooses a column from which a target is to be broken.

2) The marksman must then break the lowest remaining target in the chosen column.

If the rules are followed, in how many different orders can the eight targets be broken?
Solution

Suppose that the columns are labeled $A$, $B$, and $C$. Consider the string $AAABBBCC$. Since the arrangements of the strings is bijective to the order of shooting, the answer is the number of ways to arrange the letters which is $\frac{8!}{3! \cdot 3! \cdot 2!} = \boxed{560}$.


## 1990 AIME Problem 9

A fair coin is to be tossed $10$ times. Let $i/j$, in lowest terms, be the probability that heads never occur on consecutive tosses. Find $i+j$.
Solution Solution 1

Clearly, at least $5$ tails must be flipped; any less, then by the Pigeonhole Principle there will be heads that appear on consecutive tosses.

Consider the case when $5$ tails occur. The heads must fall between the tails such that no two heads fall between the same tails, and must fall in the positions labeled $(H)$:

$(H)\ T\ (H)\ T\ (H)\ T\ (H)\ T\ (H)\ T\ (H)$

There are six slots for the heads to be placed, but only $5$ heads remaining. Thus, using stars-and-bars there are ${6\choose5}$ possible combinations of 5 heads. Continuing this pattern, we find that there are $\sum_{i=6}^{11} {i\choose{11-i}} = {6\choose5} + {7\choose4} + {8\choose3} + {9\choose2} + {{10}\choose1} + {{11}\choose0} = 144$. There are a total of $2^{10}$ possible flips of $10$ coins, making the probability $\frac{144}{1024} = \frac{9}{64}$. Thus, our solution is $9 + 64 = \boxed{073}$.
Solution 2

Call the number of ways of flipping $n$ coins and not receiving any consecutive heads $S_n$. Notice that tails must be received in at least one of the first two flips.

If the first coin flipped is a T, then the remaining $n-1$ flips must fall under one of the configurations of $S_{n-1}$.

If the first coin flipped is a H, then the second coin must be a T. There are then $S_{n-2}$ configurations.

Thus, $S_n = S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}$. By counting, we can establish that $S_1 = 2$ and $S_2 = 3$. Therefore, $S_3 = 5,\ S_4 = 8$, forming the Fibonacci sequence. Listing them out, we get $2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144$, and the 10th number is $144$. Putting this over $2^{10}$ to find the probability, we get $\frac{9}{64}$.


## 1990 AIME Problem 10

The sets $A = \{z : z^{18} = 1\}$ and $B = \{w : w^{48} = 1\}$ are both sets of complex roots of unity. The set $C = \{zw : z \in A ~ \mbox{and} ~ w \in B\}$ is also a set of complex roots of unity. How many distinct elements are in $C$?
Solution Solution 1

The least common multiple of $18$ and $48$ is $144$, so define $n = e^{2\pi i/144}$. We can write the numbers of set $A$ as $\{n^8, n^{16}, \ldots n^{144}\}$ and of set $B$ as $\{n^3, n^6, \ldots n^{144}\}$. $n^x$ can yield at most $144$ different values. All solutions for $zw$ will be in the form of $n^{8k_1 + 3k_2}$.

$8$ and $3$ are relatively prime, and it is well known that for two relatively prime integers $a,b$, the largest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of multiples of $a,b$ is $a \cdot b - a - b$. For $3,8$, this is $13$; however, we can easily see that the numbers $145$ to $157$ can be written in terms of $3,8$. Since the exponents are of roots of unities, they reduce $\mod{144}$, so all numbers in the range are covered. Thus the answer is $\boxed{144}$.
Solution 2

The 18 and 48th roots of $1$ can be found by De Moivre's Theorem. They are $\text{cis}\,\left(\frac{2\pi k_1}{18}\right)$ and $\text{cis}\,\left(\frac{2\pi k_2}{48}\right)$ respectively, where $\text{cis}\,\theta = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta$ and $k_1$ and $k_2$ are integers from $0$ to $17$ and $0$ to $47$, respectively.

$zw = \text{cis}\,\left(\frac{\pi k_1}{9} + \frac{\pi k_2}{24}\right) = \text{cis}\,\left(\frac{8\pi k_1 + 3 \pi k_2}{72}\right)$. Since the trigonometric functions are periodic every $2\pi$, there are at most $72 \cdot 2 = 144$ distinct elements in $C$. As above, all of these will work.


## 1990 AIME Problem 11

Someone observed that $6! = 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 10$. Find the largest positive integer $n$ for which $n$ can be expressed as the product of $n - 3$ consecutive positive integers.
Solution 1

The product of $n - 3$ consecutive integers can be written as $\frac{(n - 3 + a)!}{a!}$ for some integer $a$. Thus, $n! = \frac{(n - 3 + a)!}{a!}$, from which it becomes evident that $a \ge 3$. Since $(n - 3 + a)! > n!$, we can rewrite this as $\frac{n!(n+1)(n+2) \ldots (n-3+a)}{a!} = n! \Longrightarrow (n+1)(n+2) \ldots (n-3+a) = a!$. For $a = 4$, we get $n + 1 = 4!$ so $n = 23$. For greater values of $a$, we need to find the product of $a-3$ consecutive integers that equals $a!$. $n$ can be approximated as $^{a-3}\sqrt{a!}$, which decreases as $a$ increases. Thus, $n = 23$ is the greatest possible value to satisfy the given conditions.
Solution 2

Let the largest of the $(n-3)$ consecutive positive integers be $k$. Clearly $k$ cannot be less than or equal to $n$, else the product of $(n-3)$ consecutive positive integers will be less than $n!$.

Key observation: Now for $n$ to be maximum the smallest number (or starting number) of the $(n-3)$ consecutive positive integers must be minimum, implying that k needs to be minimum. But the least $k > n$ is $(n+1).$

So the $(n-3)$ consecutive positive integers are $(5, 6, 7…, n+1)$

So we have $(n+1)! /4! = n!$ $=> n+1 = 24$ $=> n = 23$

Kris17
Generalization:

Largest positive integer n for which n! can be expressed as the product of (n-a) consecutive positive integers = (a+1)! – 1

For ex. largest n such that product of (n-6) consecutive positive integers is equal to n! is 7!-1 = 5039

Proof: Reasoning the same way as above, let the largest of the (n-a) consecutive positive integers be k. Clearly k cannot be less than or equal to n, else the product of (n-a) consecutive positive integers will be less than n!.

Now, observe that for n to be maximum the smallest number (or starting number) of the (n-a) consecutive positive integers must be minimum, implying that k needs to be minimum. But the least k > n is (n+1).

So the (n-a) consecutive positive integers are (a+2, a+3, … n+1)

So we have (n+1)! / (a+1)! = n! => n+1 = (a+1)! => n = (a+1)! -1 


## 1990 AIME Problem 12

A regular 12-gon is inscribed in a circle of radius 12. The sum of the lengths of all sides and diagonals of the 12-gon can be written in the form $a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6},$ where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are positive integers. Find $a + b + c + d$.

Solution 1

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/1/10/1990_AIME-12.png" height="200px" /></div>

The easiest way to do this seems to be to find the length of each of the sides and diagonals. To do such, draw the radii that meet the endpoints of the sides/diagonals; this will form isosceles triangles. Drawing the altitude of those triangles and then solving will yield the respective lengths.

The length of each of the 12 sides is $2 \cdot 12\sin 15$. $24\sin 15 = 24\sin (45 - 30) = 24\frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4} = 6(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})$.

The length of each of the 12 diagonals that span across 2 edges is $2 \cdot 12\sin 30 = 12$ (or notice that the triangle formed is equilateral).

The length of each of the 12 diagonals that span across 3 edges is $2 \cdot 12\sin 45 = 12\sqrt{2}$ (or notice that the triangle formed is a $45 - 45 - 90$ right triangle).

The length of each of the 12 diagonals that span across 4 edges is $2 \cdot 12\sin 60 = 12\sqrt{3}$.

The length of each of the 12 diagonals that span across 5 edges is $2 \cdot 12\sin 75 = 24\sin (45 + 30) = 24\frac{\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{2}}{4} = 6(\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{2})$.

The length of each of the 6 diameters is $2 \cdot 12 = 24$.

Adding all of these up, we get $12[6(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}) + 12 + 12\sqrt{2} + 12\sqrt{3} + 6(\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{2})] + 6 \cdot 24$

$= 12(12 + 12\sqrt{2} + 12\sqrt{3} + 12\sqrt{6}) + 144 = 288 + 144\sqrt{2} + 144\sqrt{3} + 144\sqrt{6}$. Thus, the answer is $144 \cdot 5 = \boxed{720}$.
Solution 2

A second method involves drawing a triangle connecting the center of the 12-gon to two vertices of the 12-gon. Since the distance from the center to a vertex of the 12-gon is $12$, the Law of Cosines can be applied to this isosceles triangle, to give:

$a^2 = 12^2 + 12^2 - 2\cdot 12\cdot 12\cdot \cos \theta$

$a^2 = 2\cdot 12^2 - 2\cdot 12^2 \cos \theta$

$a^2 = 2\cdot 12^2 (1 - \cos \theta)$

$a = 12\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \cos \theta}$

There are six lengths of sides/diagonals, corresponding to $\theta = {30^{\circ}, 60^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}, 120^{\circ}, 150^{\circ}, 180^{\circ}}$

Call these lengths $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6$ from shortest to longest. The total length $l$ that is asked for is

$l = 12(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5) + 6a_6$, noting that $a_6$ as written gives the diameter of the circle, which is the longest diagonal.


$l = 12[12\sqrt{2} (\sqrt{1 - \cos 30^{\circ}}+\sqrt{1-\cos 60^{\circ}}+\sqrt{1-\cos 90^{\circ}}+\sqrt{1-\cos 120^{\circ}}+\sqrt{1 - \cos 150^{\circ}})] + 6 \cdot 24$


$l = 144\sqrt{2} \left(\sqrt{1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} + \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} + \sqrt{1-0} + \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{2}} + \sqrt{1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}\right) + 144$


$l = 144\sqrt{2} \left(\sqrt{1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + 1 + \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} + \sqrt{1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}\right) + 144$


To simplify the two nested radicals, add them, and call the sum $x$:

$x = \sqrt{1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} + \sqrt{1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$

Squaring both sides, the F and L part of FOIL causes the radicals to cancel, leaving $2$:

$x^2 = 2 + 2\sqrt{\left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)}$

$x^2 = 2 + 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{3}{4}}$

$x^2 = 2 + 2\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}}$

$x^2 = 2 + 2\cdot\frac{1}{2}$

$x = \sqrt{3}.$


Plugging that sum $x$ back into the equation for $l$, we find

$l = 144\sqrt{2} \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + 1 + \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} + \sqrt{3}\right) + 144$

$l = 144 + 144\sqrt{2} + 144\sqrt{3} + 144\sqrt{6} + 144$.

Thus, the desired quantity is $144\cdot 5 = \boxed{720}$. 

## 1990 AIME Problem 13
Problem

Let $T = \{9^k : k ~ \mbox{is an integer}, 0 \le k \le 4000\}$. Given that $9^{4000}_{}$ has 3817 digits and that its first (leftmost) digit is 9, how many elements of $T$ have 9 as their leftmost digit?
Solution

Whenever you multiply a number by $9$, the number will have an additional digit over the previous digit, with the exception when the new number starts with a $9$, when the number of digits remain the same. Since $9^{4000}$ has 3816 digits more than $9^1$, exactly $4000 - (3817 - 1) = 184$ numbers have 9 as their leftmost digits. 

## 1990 AIME Problem 14

The rectangle $ABCD$ below has dimensions $AB = 12 \sqrt{3}$ and $BC = 13 \sqrt{3}$. Diagonals $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$ intersect at $P$. If triangle $ABP$ is cut out and removed, edges $\overline{AP}$ and $\overline{BP}$ are joined, and the figure is then creased along segments $\overline{CP}$ and $\overline{DP}$, we obtain a triangular pyramid, all four of whose faces are isosceles triangles. Find the volume of this pyramid.

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/1/0/0/1000e30e6f2569a527b722be1df0f5760223056a.png" height="150px" /></div>

Solution Solution 1

Our triangular pyramid has base $12\sqrt{3} - 13\sqrt{3} - 13\sqrt{3} \triangle$. The area of this isosceles triangle is easy to find by $[ACD] = \frac{1}{2}bh$, where we can find $h_{ACD}$ to be $\sqrt{399}$ by the Pythagorean Theorem. Thus $A = \frac 12(12\sqrt{3})\sqrt{399} = 18\sqrt{133}$.

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/4/d/0/4d0542b2fd08bce2046cb8d05182b09ec35535e4.png" height="150px" /></div>

To find the volume, we want to use the equation $\frac 13Bh = 6\sqrt{133}h$, so we need to find the height of the tetrahedron. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $AP = CP = DP = \frac{\sqrt{939}}{2}$. If we let $P$ be the center of a sphere with radius $\frac{\sqrt{939}}{2}$, then $A,C,D$ lie on the sphere. The cross section of the sphere that contains $A,C,D$ is a circle, and the center of that circle is the foot of the perpendicular from the center of the sphere. Hence the foot of the height we want to find occurs at the circumcenter of $\triangle ACD$.

From here we just need to perform some brutish calculations. Using the formula $A = 18\sqrt{133} = \frac{abc}{4R}$ (where $R$ is the circumradius), we find $R = \frac{12\sqrt{3} \cdot (13\sqrt{3})^2}{4\cdot 18\sqrt{133}} = \frac{13^2\sqrt{3}}{2\sqrt{133}}$ (there are slightly simpler ways to calculate $R$ since we have an isosceles triangle). By the Pythagorean Theorem,

$\begin{align*}h^2 &= PA^2 - R^2 \\ &= \left(\frac{\sqrt{939}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{13^2\sqrt{3}}{2\sqrt{133}}\right)^2\\ &= \frac{939 \cdot 133 - 13^4 \cdot 3}{4 \cdot 133} = \frac{13068 \cdot 3}{4 \cdot 133} = \frac{99^2}{133}\\ h &= \frac{99}{\sqrt{133}} \end{align*}$

Finally, we substitute $h$ into the volume equation to find $V = 6\sqrt{133}\left(\frac{99}{\sqrt{133}}\right) = \boxed{594}$.
Solution 2

Let $\triangle{ABC}$ (or the triangle with sides $12\sqrt {3}$, $13\sqrt {3}$, $13\sqrt {3}$) be the base of our tetrahedron. We set points $C$ and $D$ as $(6\sqrt {3}, 0, 0)$ and $( - 6\sqrt {3}, 0, 0)$, respectively. Using Pythagoras, we find $A$ as $(0, \sqrt {399}, 0)$. We know that the vertex of the tetrahedron ($P$) has to be of the form $(x, y, z)$, where $z$ is the altitude of the tetrahedron. Since the distance from $P$ to points $A$, $B$, and $C$ is $\frac {\sqrt {939}}{2}$, we can write three equations using the distance formula:

$\begin{align*} x^{2} + (y - \sqrt {399})^{2} + z^{2} &= \frac {939}{4}\\ (x - 6\sqrt {3})^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} &= \frac {939}{4}\\ (x + 6\sqrt {3})^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} &= \frac {939}{4} \end{align*}$

Subtracting the last two equations, we get $x = 0$. Solving for $y,z$ with a bit of effort, we eventually get $x = 0$, $y = \frac {291}{2\sqrt {399}}$, $z = \frac {99}{\sqrt {133}}$. Since the area of a triangle is $\frac {1}{2}\cdot bh$, we have the base area as $18\sqrt {133}$. Thus, the volume is $V = \frac {1}{3}\cdot18\sqrt {133}\cdot\frac {99}{\sqrt {133}} = 6\cdot99 = 594$.

Find $ax^5 + by^5$ if the real numbers $a$, $b$, $x$, and $y$ satisfy the equations $ax + by = 3,$ $ax^2 + by^2 = 7,$ $ax^3 + by^3 = 16,$ $ax^4 + by^4 = 42.$
Solution 1

Set $S = (x + y)$ and $P = xy$. Then the relationship

$(ax^n + by^n)(x + y) = (ax^{n + 1} + by^{n + 1}) + (xy)(ax^{n - 1} + by^{n - 1})$

can be exploited:

$\begin{eqnarray*}(ax^2 + by^2)(x + y) & = & (ax^3 + by^3) + (xy)(ax + by) \\ (ax^3 + by^3)(x + y) & = & (ax^4 + by^4) + (xy)(ax^2 + by^2)\end{eqnarray*}$

Therefore:

$\begin{eqnarray*}7S & = & 16 + 3P \\ 16S & = & 42 + 7P\end{eqnarray*}$

Consequently, $S = - 14$ and $P = - 38$. Finally:

$\begin{eqnarray*}(ax^4 + by^4)(x + y) & = & (ax^5 + by^5) + (xy)(ax^3 + by^3) \\ (42)(S) & = & (ax^5 + by^5) + (P)(16) \\ (42)( - 14) & = & (ax^5 + by^5) + ( - 38)(16) \\ ax^5 + by^5 & = & \boxed{20}\end{eqnarray*}$
Solution 2

A recurrence of the form $T_n=AT_{n-1}+BT_{n-2}$ will have the closed form $T_n=ax^n+by^n$, where $x,y$ are the values of the starting term that make the sequence geometric, and $a,b$ are the appropriately chosen constants such that those special starting terms linearly combine to form the actual starting terms.

Suppose we have such a recurrence with $T_1=3$ and $T_2=7$. Then $T_3=ax^3+by^3=16=7A+3B$, and $T_4=ax^4+by^4=42=16A+7B$.

Solving these simultaneous equations for $A$ and $B$, we see that $A=-14$ and $B=38$. So, $ax^5+by^5=T_5=-14(42)+38(16)= \boxed{20}$.

## 1989 AIME Problem 1

Compute $\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28)+1}$.
Solution
Solution 1

Notice ${31*28 = 868}$ and ${30*29 =870}$. So now our expression is $\sqrt{(870)(868) + 1}$. Setting 870 equal to $y$, we get $\sqrt{(y-1)^{2}}$ which then equals ${(y-1)}$. So since ${y = 870}$, ${y-1}=869$, our answer is $\boxed{869}$.
Solution 2

Note that the four numbers to multiply are symmetric with the center at $29.5$. Multiply the symmetric pairs to get $31\cdot 28=868$ and $30\cdot 29=870$. $\sqrt{868\cdot 870 + 1} = \sqrt{(869-1)(869+1) + 1} = \sqrt{869^2 - 1^2 + 1} = \sqrt{869^2} = \boxed{869}$.
Solution 3

The last digit under the radical is $1$, so the square root must either end in $1$ or $9$, since $x^2 = 1\mod {10}$ means $x = \pm 1$. Additionally, the number must be near $29 \cdot 30 = 870$, narrowing the reasonable choices to $869$ and $871$.

Continuing the logic, the next-to-last digit under the radical is the same as the last digit of $28 \cdot 29 \cdot 3 \cdot 31$, which is $6$. Quick computation shows that $869^2$ ends in $61$, while $871^2$ ends in $41$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{869}$.
Solution 4

Similar to Solution 1 above, call the consecutive integers $\left(n-\frac{3}{2}\right), \left(n-\frac{1}{2}\right), \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right), \left(n+\frac{3}{2}\right)$ to make use of symmetry. Note that $n$ itself is not an integer - in this case, $n = 29.5$. The expression becomes $\sqrt{\left(n-\frac{3}{2}\right)\left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right)\left(n - \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) + 1}$. Distributing each pair of difference of squares first, and then distributing the two resulting quadratics and adding the constant, gives $\sqrt{n^4 - \frac{5}{2}n^2 + \frac{25}{16}}$. The inside is a perfect square trinomial, since $b^2 = 4ac$. It's equal to $\sqrt{\left(n^2 - \frac{5}{4}\right)^2}$, which simplifies to $n^2 - \frac{5}{4}$. You can plug in the value of $n$ from there, or further simplify to $\left(n - \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) - 1$, which is easier to compute. Either way, plugging in $n=29.5$ gives $\boxed{869}$.


## 1989 AIME Problem 2

Ten points are marked on a circle. How many distinct convex polygons of three or more sides can be drawn using some (or all) of the ten points as vertices?
Solution

Any subset of the ten points with three or more members can be made into exactly one such polygon. Thus, we need to count the number of such subsets. There are $2^{10} = 1024$ total subsets of a ten-member set, but of these ${10 \choose 0} = 1$ have 0 members, ${10 \choose 1} = 10$ have 1 member and ${10 \choose 2} = 45$ have 2 members. Thus the answer is $1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 = 968$.

Note ${N \choose 0}+{N \choose 1} + {N \choose 2} + \dots + {N \choose N}$ is equivalent to $2^N$


## 1989 AIME Problem 3

Suppose $n$ is a positive integer and $d$ is a single digit in base 10. Find $n$ if $\frac{n}{810}=0.d25d25d25\ldots$
Solution

Repeating decimals represent rational numbers. To figure out which rational number, we sum an infinite geometric series, $0.d25d25d25\ldots = \sum_{i = 1}^\infty \frac{d25}{1000^n} = \frac{100d + 25}{999}$. Thus $\frac{n}{810} = \frac{100d + 25}{999}$ so $n = 30\frac{100d + 25}{37} =750\frac{4d + 1}{37}$. Since 750 and 37 are relatively prime, $4d + 1$ must be divisible by 37, and the only digit for which this is possible is $d = 9$. Thus $4d + 1 = 37$ and $n = 750$.


## 1989 AIME Problem 4

If $a<b<c<d<e$ are consecutive positive integers such that $b+c+d$ is a perfect square and $a+b+c+d+e$ is a perfect cube, what is the smallest possible value of $c$?
Solution

Since the middle term of an arithmetic progression with an odd number of terms is the average of the series, we know $b + c + d = 3c$ and $a + b + c + d + e = 5c$. Thus, $c$ must be in the form of $3 \cdot x^2$ based upon the first part and in the form of $5^2 \cdot y^3$ based upon the second part, with $x$ and $y$ denoting an integers. $c$ is minimized if itâ€™s prime factorization contains only $3,5$, and since there is a cubed term in $5^2 \cdot y^3$, $3^3$ must be a factor of $c$. $3^35^2 = 675$, which works as the solution.


## 1989 AIME Problem 5

When a certain biased coin is flipped five times, the probability of getting heads exactly once is not equal to $0$ and is the same as that of getting heads exactly twice. Let $\frac ij$, in lowest terms, be the probability that the coin comes up heads in exactly $3$ out of $5$ flips. Find $i+j$.
Solution

Denote the probability of getting a heads in one flip of the biased coins as $h$. Based upon the problem, note that ${5\choose1}(h)^1(1-h)^4 = {5\choose2}(h)^2(1-h)^3$. After canceling out terms, we get $1 - h = 2h$, so $h = \frac{1}{3}$. The answer we are looking for is ${5\choose3}(h)^3(1-h)^2 = 10\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{40}{243}$, so $i+j=40+243=\boxed{283}$.


## 1989 AIME Problem 6

Two skaters, Allie and Billie, are at points $A$ and $B$, respectively, on a flat, frozen lake. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is $100$ meters. Allie leaves $A$ and skates at a speed of $8$ meters per second on a straight line that makes a $60^\circ$ angle with $AB$. At the same time Allie leaves $A$, Billie leaves $B$ at a speed of $7$ meters per second and follows the straight path that produces the earliest possible meeting of the two skaters, given their speeds. How many meters does Allie skate before meeting Billie?

Solution

Label the point of intersection as $C$. Since $d = rt$, $AC = 8t$ and $BC = 7t$. According to the law of cosines,

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/a/e/d/aedca2f1d05dc487c293ffbc289231edb6ca2cb9.png" height="150px" /></div>

$\begin{align*}(7t)^2 &= (8t)^2 + 100^2 - 2 \cdot 8t \cdot 100 \cdot \cos 60^\circ\\ 0 &= 15t^2 - 800t + 10000 = 3t^2 - 160t + 2000\\ t &= \frac{160 \pm \sqrt{160^2 - 4\cdot 3 \cdot 2000}}{6} = 20, \frac{100}{3}.\end{align*}$

Since we are looking for the earliest possible intersection, $20$ seconds are needed. Thus, $8 \cdot 20 = \boxed{160}$ meters is the solution.


## 1989 AIME Problem 7

If the integer $k$ is added to each of the numbers $36$, $300$, and $596$, one obtains the squares of three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series. Find $k$.
Solution

Call the terms of the arithmetic progression $a,\ a + d,\ a + 2d$, making their squares $a^2,\ a^2 + 2ad + d^2,\ a^2 + 4ad + 4d^2$.

We know that $a^2 = 36 + k$ and $(a + d)^2 = 300 + k$, and subtracting these two we get $264 = 2ad + d^2$ (1). Similarly, using $(a + d)^2 = 300 + k$ and $(a + 2d)^2 = 596 + k$, subtraction yields $296 = 2ad + 3d^2$ (2).

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $2d^2 = 32$, so $d = 4$. Substituting backwards yields that $a = 31$ and $k = 925$.


## 1989 AIME Problem 8

Assume that $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_7$ are real numbers such that $\begin{align*}x_1+4x_2+9x_3+16x_4+25x_5+36x_6+49x_7&=1\\ 4x_1+9x_2+16x_3+25x_4+36x_5+49x_6+64x_7&=12\\ 9x_1+16x_2+25x_3+36x_4+49x_5+64x_6+81x_7&=123\end{align*}$.

Find the value of $16x_1+25x_2+36x_3+49x_4+64x_5+81x_6+100x_7$.

Solution
Solution 1

Notice that because we are given a system of $3$ equations with $7$ unknowns, the values $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_7)$ are not fixed; indeed one can take any four of the variables and assign them arbitrary values, which will in turn fix the last three.


Given this, we suspect there is a way to derive the last expression as a linear combination of the three given expressions. Let the coefficent of $x_i$ in the first equation be $y_i^2$; then its coefficients in the second equation is $(y_i+1)^{2}$ and the third as $(y_i+2)^2$. We need to find a way to sum these to make $(y_i+3)^2$ [this is in fact a specific approach generalized by the next solution below].

Thus, we hope to find constants $a,b,c$ satisfying $ay_i^2 + b(y_i+1)^2 + c(y_i+2)^2 = (y_i + 3)^2$. FOILing out all of the terms, we get
$[ay^2 + by^2 + cy^2] + [2by + 4cy] + b + 4c = y^2 + 6y + 9.$

Comparing coefficents gives us the three equation system:

$\begin{align*}a + b + c &= 1 \\ 2b + 4c &= 6 \\ b + 4c &= 9 \end{align*}$

Subtracting the second and third equations yields that $b = -3$, so $c = 3$ and $a = 1$. It follows that the desired expression is $a \cdot (1) + b \cdot (12) + c \cdot (123) = 1 - 36 + 369 = \boxed{334}$.
Solution 2

Notice that we may rewrite the equations in the more compact form as:

$\sum_{i=1}^{7}i^2x_i=c_1,\ \ \sum_{i=1}^{7}(i+1)^2x_i=c_2,\ \ \sum_{i=1}^{7}(i+2)^2x_i=c_3,$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{7}(i+3)^2x_i=c_4,$

where $c_1=1, c_2=12, c_3=123,$ and $c_4$ is what we're trying to find.

Now consider the polynomial given by $f(z) := \sum_{i=1}^7 (z+i)^2x_i$ (we are only treating the $x_i$ as coefficients).

Notice that $f$ is in fact a quadratic. We are given $f(0), \ f(1), \ f(2)$ as $c_1, \ c_2, \ c_3$ and are asked to find $c_4$. Using the concept of finite differences (a prototype of differentiation) we find that the second differences of consecutive values is constant, so that by arithmetic operations we find $c_4=334$.


Alternatively, applying finite differences, one obtains $c_4 = {3 \choose 2}f(2) - {3 \choose 1}f(1) + {3 \choose 0}f(0) =334$.
Solution 3

Notice that $3(n+2)^2-3(n+1)^2+n^2=(n+3)^2$

I'll number the equations for convenience

$\begin{align} x_1+4x_2+9x_3+16x_4+25x_5+36x_6+49x_7&=1\\ 4x_1+9x_2+16x_3+25x_4+36x_5+49x_6+64x_7&=12\\ 9x_1+16x_2+25x_3+36x_4+49x_5+64x_6+81x_7&=123\\ 16x_1+25x_2+36x_3+49x_4+64x_5+81x_6+100x_7&=\end{align}$

Let the coefficient of $x_i$ in $(1)$ be $n^2$. Then the coefficient of $x_i$ in $(2)$ is $(n+1)^2$ etc.

Therefore, $3*(3)-3*(2)+(1)=(4)$

So $(4)=3*123-3*12+1=\boxed{334}$
Solution 4

Notice subracting the first equation from the second yields $3x_1 + 5x_2 + ... + 15x_7 = 11$ Then, repeating for the 2nd and 3rd equations, and then subtracting the result from the first obtained equation, we get $2x_1 + 2x_2 + ... +2x_7 = 100$. Adding this twice to the first obtained equation gives difference of the desired equation and 3rd equation, which is 211. Adding to the 3rd equation, we get $\boxed{334}$


## 1989 AIME Problem 9

One of Euler's conjectures was disproved in the 1960s by three American mathematicians when they showed there was a positive integer such that $133^5+110^5+84^5+27^5=n^{5}$. Find the value of $n$.
Solution

Note that $n$ is even, since the $LHS$ consists of two odd and two even numbers. By Fermat's Little Theorem, we know ${n^{5}}$ is congruent to $n$ modulo 5. Hence,
$3 + 0 + 4 + 7 \equiv n\mod{5}$
$4 \equiv n\mod{5}$

Continuing, we examine the equation modulo 3,
$1 - 1 + 0 + 0 \equiv n\mod{3}$
$0 \equiv n\mod{3}$

Thus, $n$ is divisible by three and leaves a remainder of four when divided by 5. It's obvious that $n>133$, so the only possibilities are $n = 144$ or $n \geq 174$. It quickly becomes apparent that 174 is much too large, so $n$ must be $\boxed{144}$.


## 1989 AIME Problem 10

Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be the three sides of a triangle, and let $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, be the angles opposite them. If $a^2+b^2=1989c^2$, find
$\frac{\cot \gamma}{\cot \alpha+\cot \beta}$

Solution
Solution 1

We can draw the altitude $h$ to $c$, to get two right triangles. $\cot{\alpha}+\cot{\beta}=\frac{c}{h}$, from the definition of the cotangent. From the definition of area, $h=\frac{2A}{c}$, so $\cot{\alpha}+\cot{\beta}=\frac{c^2}{2A}$.

Now we evaluate the numerator:

$\cot{\gamma}=\frac{\cos{\gamma}}{\sin{\gamma}}$

From the Law of Cosines and the sine area formula,

$\begin{align*}\cos{\gamma}&=\frac{1988c^2}{2ab}\\ \sin{\gamma}&= \frac{2A}{ab}\\ \cot{\gamma}&= \frac{\cos \gamma}{\sin \gamma} = \frac{1988c^2}{4A} \end{align*}$

Then $\frac{\cot \gamma}{\cot \alpha+\cot \beta}=\frac{\frac{1988c^2}{4A}}{\frac{c^2}{2A}}=\frac{1988}{2}=\boxed{994}$.
Solution 2

$\begin{align*} \cot{\alpha} + \cot{\beta} &= \frac {\cos{\alpha}}{\sin{\alpha}} + \frac {\cos{\beta}}{\sin{\beta}} = \frac {\sin{\alpha}\cos{\beta} + \cos{\alpha}\sin{\beta}}{\sin{\alpha}\sin{\beta}}\\ &= \frac {\sin{(\alpha + \beta)}}{\sin{\alpha}\sin{\beta}} = \frac {\sin{\gamma}}{\sin{\alpha}\sin{\beta}} \end{align*}$

By the Law of Cosines,

$a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos{\gamma} = c^2 = 1989c^2 - 2ab\cos{\gamma} \implies ab\cos{\gamma} = 994c^2$

Now

$\begin{align*}\frac {\cot{\gamma}}{\cot{\alpha} + \cot{\beta}} &= \frac {\cot{\gamma}\sin{\alpha}\sin{\beta}}{\sin{\gamma}} = \frac {\cos{\gamma}\sin{\alpha}\sin{\beta}}{\sin^2{\gamma}} = \frac {ab}{c^2}\cos{\gamma} = \frac {ab}{c^2} \cdot \frac {994c^2}{ab}\\ &= \boxed{994}\end{align*}$


Solution 3

Use Law of cosines to give us $c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\cos(\gamma)$ or therefore $\cos(\gamma)=\frac{994c^2}{ab}$. Next, we are going to put all the sin's in term of $\sin(a)$. We get $\sin(\gamma)=\frac{c\sin(a)}{a}$. Therefore, we get $\cot(\gamma)=\frac{994c}{b\sin a}$.

Next, use Law of Cosines to give us $b^2=a^2+c^2-2ac\cos(\beta)$. Therefore, $\cos(\beta)=\frac{a^2-994c^2}{ac}$. Also, $\sin(\beta)=\frac{b\sin(a)}{a}$. Hence, $\cot(\beta)=\frac{a^2-994c^2}{bc\sin(a)}$.

Lastly, $\cos(\alpha)=\frac{b^2-994c^2}{bc}$. Therefore, we get $\cot(\alpha)=\frac{b^2-994c^2}{bc\sin(a)}$.

Now, $\frac{\cot(\gamma)}{\cot(\beta)+\cot(\alpha)}=\frac{\frac{994c}{b\sin a}}{\frac{a^2-994c^2+b^2-994c^2}{bc\sin(a)}}$. After using $a^2+b^2=1989c^2$, we get $\frac{994c*bc\sin a}{c^2b\sin a}=\boxed{994}$.


## 1989 AIME Problem 11

A sample of 121 integers is given, each between 1 and 1000 inclusive, with repetitions allowed. The sample has a unique mode (most frequent value). Let $D$ be the difference between the mode and the arithmetic mean of the sample. What is the largest possible value of $\lfloor D\rfloor$? (For real $x$, $\lfloor x\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.)
Solution

Let the mode be $x$, which we let appear $n > 1$ times. We let the arithmetic mean be $M$, and the sum of the numbers $\neq x$ be $S$. Then $\begin{align*} D &= \left|M-x\right| = \left|\frac{S+xn}{121}-x\right| = \left|\frac{S}{121}-\left(\frac{121-n}{121}\right)x\right| \end{align*}$ As $S$ is essentially independent of $x$, it follows that we wish to minimize or maximize $x$ (in other words, $x=1,1000$). Indeed, $D(x)$ is symmetric about $x = 500.5$; consider replacing all of numbers $x_i$ in the sample with $1001-x_i$, and the value of $D$ remains the same. So, without loss of generality, let $x=1$. Now, we would like to maximize the quantity
$\frac{S}{121}-\left(\frac{121-n}{121}\right)(1) = \frac{S+n}{121}-1$

$S$ contains $121-n$ numbers that may appear at most $n-1$ times. Therefore, to maximize $S$, we would have $1000$ appear $n-1$ times, $999$ appear $n-1$ times, and so forth. We can thereby represent $S$ as the sum of $n-1$ arithmetic series of $1000, 999, \ldots, 1001 - \left\lfloor \frac{121-n}{n-1} \right\rfloor$. We let $k = \left\lfloor \frac{121-n}{n-1} \right\rfloor$, so
$S = (n-1)\left[\frac{k(1000 + 1001 - k)}{2}\right] + R(n)$

where $R(n)$ denotes the sum of the remaining $121-(n-1)k$ numbers, namely $R(n) = (121-(n-1)k)(1000-k)$.

At this point, we introduce the crude estimate[1] that $k=\frac{121-n}{n-1}$, so $R(n) = 0$ and $\begin{align*}2S+2n &= (121-n)\left(2001-\frac{121-n}{n-1}\right)+2n = (120-(n-1))\left(2002-\frac{120}{n-1}\right)\end{align*}$ Expanding (ignoring the constants, as these do not affect which $n$ yields a maximum) and scaling, we wish to minimize the expression $5(n-1) + \frac{36}{n-1}$. By AM-GM, we have $5(n-1) + \frac{36}{n-1} \ge 2\sqrt{5(n-1) \cdot \frac{36}{n-1}}$, with equality coming when $5(n-1) = \frac{36}{n-1}$, so $n-1 \approx 3$. Substituting this result and some arithmetic gives an answer of $\boxed{947}$.

In less formal language, it quickly becomes clear after some trial and error that in our sample, there will be $n$ values equal to one and $n-1$ values each of $1000, 999, 998 \ldots$. It is fairly easy to find the maximum. Try $n=2$, which yields $924$, $n=3$, which yields $942$, $n=4$, which yields $947$, and $n=5$, which yields $944$. The maximum difference occurred at $n=4$, so the answer is $947$.
Notes

^ In fact, when $n = 2,3,4,5$ (which some simple testing shows that the maximum will occur around), it turns out that $\frac{121-n}{n-1}$ is an integer anyway, so indeed $k = \left\lfloor \frac{121-n}{n-1} \right\rfloor = \frac{121-n}{n-1}$.



## 1989 AIME Problem 12

Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron with $AB=41$, $AC=7$, $AD=18$, $BC=36$, $BD=27$, and $CD=13$, as shown in the figure. Let $d$ be the distance between the midpoints of edges $AB$ and $CD$. Find $d^{2}$.

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/c/cc/AIME_1989_Problem_12.png" height="150px" /></div>

Solution

Call the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ $M$ and the midpoint of $\overline{CD}$ $N$. $d$ is the median of triangle $\triangle CDM$. The formula for the length of a median is $m=\sqrt{\frac{2a^2+2b^2-c^2}{4}}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the side lengths of triangle, and $c$ is the side that is bisected by median $m$. The formula is a direct result of the Law of Cosines applied twice with the angles formed by the median (Stewart's Theorem).

We first find $CM$, which is the median of $\triangle CAB$.

$CM=\sqrt{\frac{98+2592-1681}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{1009}}{2}$

Now we must find $DM$, which is the median of $\triangle DAB$.

$DM=\frac{\sqrt{425}}{2}$

Now that we know the sides of $\triangle CDM$, we proceed to find the length of $d$.

$d=\frac{\sqrt{548}}{2} \Longrightarrow d^2=\frac{548}{4}=\boxed{137}$


## 1989 AIME Problem 13

Let $S$ be a subset of $\{1,2,3,\ldots,1989\}$ such that no two members of $S$ differ by $4$ or $7$. What is the largest number of elements $S$ can have?
Solution

We first show that we can choose at most 5 numbers from $\{1, 2, \ldots , 11\}$ such that no two numbers have a difference of $4$ or $7$. We take the smallest number to be $1$, which rules out $5,8$. Now we can take at most one from each of the pairs: $[2,9]$, $[3,7]$, $[4,11]$, $[6,10]$. Now, $1989 = 180\cdot 11 + 9$. Because this isn't an exact multiple of $11$, we need to consider some numbers separately.

Notice that $1969 = 180\cdot11 - 11 = 179\cdot11$. Therefore we can put the last $1969$ numbers into groups of 11. Now let's examine $\{1, 2, \ldots , 20\}$. If we pick $1, 3, 4, 6, 9$ from the first $11$ numbers, then we're allowed to pick $11 + 1$, $11 + 3$, $11 + 4$, $11 + 6$, $11 + 9$. This means we get 10 members from the 20 numbers. Our answer is thus $179\cdot 5 + 10 = \boxed{905}$.


## 1989 AIME Problem 14

Given a positive integer $n$, it can be shown that every complex number of the form $r+si$, where $r$ and $s$ are integers, can be uniquely expressed in the base $-n+i$ using the integers $1,2,\ldots,n^2$ as digits. That is, the equation
$r+si=a_m(-n+i)^m+a_{m-1}(-n+i)^{m-1}+\cdots +a_1(-n+i)+a_0$

is true for a unique choice of non-negative integer $m$ and digits $a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_m$ chosen from the set $\{0,1,2,\ldots,n^2\}$, with $a_m\ne 0$. We write
$r+si=(a_ma_{m-1}\ldots a_1a_0)_{-n+i}$

to denote the base $-n+i$ expansion of $r+si$. There are only finitely many integers $k+0i$ that have four-digit expansions
$k=(a_3a_2a_1a_0)_{-3+i}~~$

$~~a_3\ne 0.$

Find the sum of all such $k$.
Solution

First, we find the first three powers of $-3+i$:

$(-3+i)^1=-3+i ; (-3+i)^2=8-6i ; (-3+i)^3=-18+26i$

So we need to solve the diophantine equation $a_1-6a_2+26a_3=0 \Longrightarrow a_1-6a_2=-26a_3$.

The minimum the left hand side can go is -54, so $a_3\leq 2$, so we try cases:

Case 1: $a_3=2$

The only solution to that is $(a_1, a_2, a_3)=(2,9,2)$.

Case 2: $a_3=1$

The only solution to that is $(a_1, a_2, a_3)=(4,5,1)$.

Case 3: $a_3=0$

$a_3$ cannot be 0, or else we do not have a four digit number.

So we have the four digit integers $(292a_0)_{-3+i}$ and $(154a_0)_{-3+i}$, and we need to find the sum of all integers $k$ that can be expressed by one of those.

$(292a_0)_{-3+i}$:

We plug the first three digits into base 10 to get $30+a_0$. The sum of the integers $k$ in that form is $345$.

$(154a_0)_{-3+i}$:

We plug the first three digits into base 10 to get $10+a_0$. The sum of the integers $k$ in that form is $145$. The answer is $345+145=\boxed{490}$.


## 1989 AIME Problem 15

Point $P$ is inside $\triangle ABC$. Line segments $APD$, $BPE$, and $CPF$ are drawn with $D$ on $BC$, $E$ on $AC$, and $F$ on $AB$ (see the figure below). Given that $AP=6$, $BP=9$, $PD=6$, $PE=3$, and $CF=20$, find the area of $\triangle ABC$.

Solution
Solution 1

Because we're given three concurrent cevians and their lengths, it seems very tempting to apply Mass points. We immediately see that $w_E = 3$, $w_B = 1$, and $w_A = w_D = 2$. Now, we recall that the masses on the three sides of the triangle must be balanced out, so $w_C = 1$ and $w_F = 3$. Thus, $CP = 15$ and $PF = 5$.

Recalling that $w_C = w_B = 1$, we see that $DC = DB$ and $DP$ is a median to $BC$ in $\triangle BCP$. Applying Stewart's Theorem, $BC^2 + 12^2 = 2(15^2 + 9^2)$, and $BC = 6\sqrt {13}$. Now notice that $2[BCP] = [ABC]$, because both triangles share the same base and the $h_{\triangle ABC} = 2h_{\triangle BCP}$. Applying Heron's formula on triangle $BCP$ with sides $15$, $9$, and $6\sqrt{13}$, $[BCP] = 54$ and $[ABC] = \boxed{108}$.
Solution 2

Using a different form of Ceva's Theorem, we have $\frac {y}{x + y} + \frac {6}{6 + 6} + \frac {3}{3 + 9} = 1\Longleftrightarrow\frac {y}{x + y} = \frac {1}{4}$

Solving $4y = x + y$ and $x + y = 20$, we obtain $x = BP = 15$ and $y = FP = 5$.

Let $Q$ be the point on $AB$ such that $FC \parallel QD$. Since $AP = PD$ and $FP\parallel QD$, $QD = 2FP = 10$. (Stewart's Theorem)

Also, since $FC\parallel QD$ and $QD = \frac{FC}{2}$, we see that $FQ = QB$, $BD = DC$, etc. (Stewart's Theorem) Similarly, we have $PR = RB$ ($= \frac12PB = 7.5$) and thus $RD = \frac12PC = 4.5$.

$PDR$ is a $3-4-5$ right triangle, so $\angle PDR$ ($\angle ADQ$) is $90^\circ$. Therefore, the area of $\triangle ADQ = \frac12\cdot 12\cdot 6 = 36$. Using area ratio, $\triangle ABC = \triangle ADB\times 2 = \left(\triangle ADQ\times \frac32\right)\times 2 = 36\cdot 3 = \boxed{108}$.
Solution 3

Because the length of cevian $BE$ is unknown, we can examine what happens when we extend it or decrease its length and see that it simply changes the angles between the cevians. Wouldn't it be great if it the length of $BE$ was such that $\angle APC = 90^\circ$? Let's first assume it's a right angle and hope that everything works out.

Extend $AD$ to $Q$ so that $PD = DQ = 6$. The result is that $BQ = 9$, $PQ = 12$, and $BP = 15$ because $\triangle CDP\cong \triangle BDQ$. Now we see that if we are able to show that $BE = 20$, that is $PE = 5$, then our right angle assumption will be true.

Apply the Pythagorean Theorem on $\triangle APC$ to get $AC = 3\sqrt {13}$, so $AE = \sqrt {13}$ and $CE = 2\sqrt {13}$. Now, we apply the Law of Cosines on triangles $CEP$ and $AEP$.

Let $PE = x$. Notice that $\angle CEB = 180^\circ - \angle AEB$ and $\cos CEB = - \cos AEB$, so we get two nice equations.

$81 = 52 + y^2 - 2y \sqrt {13}\cos CEF$ $36 = 13 + y^2 + y \sqrt {13} \cos CEF$

Solving, $y = 5$ (yay!).

Now, the area is easy to find. $[ABC] = [AQB] + [APC] = \frac12(9)(18) + \frac12(6)(9) = \boxed{108}$.

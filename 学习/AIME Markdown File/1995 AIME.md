## 1995 AIME Problem 1

Square $S_{1}$ is $1\times 1.$ For $i\ge 1,$ the lengths of the sides of square $S_{i+1}$ are half the lengths of the sides of square $S_{i},$ two adjacent sides of square $S_{i}$ are perpendicular bisectors of two adjacent sides of square $S_{i+1},$ and the other two sides of square $S_{i+1},$ are the perpendicular bisectors of two adjacent sides of square $S_{i+2}.$ The total area enclosed by at least one of $S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{3}, S_{4}, S_{5}$ can be written in the form $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m-n.$

Solution

The sum of the areas of the squares if they were not interconnected is a geometric sequence:

$1^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{16}\right)^2$

Then subtract the areas of the intersections, which is $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \ldots + \left(\frac{1}{32}\right)^2$:

$1^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{16}\right)^2 - \left[\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{16}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{32}\right)^2\right]$
$= 1 + \frac{1}{2}^2 - \frac{1}{32}^2$

The majority of the terms cancel, leaving $1 + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{1024}$, which simplifies down to $\frac{1024 + \left(256 - 1\right)}{1024}$. Thus, $m-n = \boxed{255}$.

Alternatively, take the area of the first square and add $\,\frac{3}{4}$ of the areas of the remaining squares. This results in $1+ \frac{3}{4}\left[\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \ldots + \left(\frac{1}{16}^2\right)\right]$, which when simplified will produce the same answer.


## 1995 AIME Problem 2


Find the last three digits of the product of the positive roots of $\sqrt{1995}x^{\log_{1995}x}=x^2$.
Solution 1

Taking the $\log_{1995}$ (logarithm) of both sides and then moving to one side yields the quadratic equation $2(\log_{1995}x)^2 - 4(\log_{1995}x) + 1 = 0$. Applying the quadratic formula yields that $\log_{1995}x = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Thus, the product of the two roots (both of which are positive) is $1995^{1+\sqrt{2}/2} \cdot 1995^{1 - \sqrt{2}/2} = 1995^2$, making the solution $(2000-5)^2 \equiv \boxed{025} \mod{1000}$.
Solution 2

Instead of taking $\log_{1995}$, we take $\log_x$ of both sides and simplify:

$\log_x(\sqrt{1995}x^{\log_{1995}x})=\log_x(x^{2})$

$\log_x\sqrt{1995}+\log_x x^{\log_{1995}x}=2$

$\frac{1}{2} \log_x 1995 + \log_{1995} x = 2$

We know that $\log_x 1995$ and $\log_{1995} x$ are reciprocals, so let $a=\log_{1995} x$. Then we have $\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{a}\right) + a = 2$. Multiplying by $2a$ and simplifying gives us $2a^2-4a+1=0$, as shown above.

Because $a=\log_{1995} x$, $x=1995^a$. By the quadratic formula, the two roots of our equation are $a=\frac{2\pm\sqrt2}{2}$. This means our two roots in terms of $x$ are $1995^\frac{2+\sqrt2}{2}$ and $1995^\frac{2-\sqrt2}{2}.$ Multiplying these gives $1995^2$

$1995^2\mod{1000}\equiv 995^2\mod{1000}\equiv (-5)^2\mod{1000}\equiv 25\mod{1000}$, so our answer is $\boxed{025}$.


## 1995 AIME Problem 3

Starting at $(0,0),$ an object moves in the coordinate plane via a sequence of steps, each of length one. Each step is left, right, up, or down, all four equally likely. Let $p$ be the probability that the object reaches $(2,2)$ in six or fewer steps. Given that $p$ can be written in the form $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n.$
Solution

It takes an even number of steps for the object to reach $(2,2)$, so the number of steps the object may have taken is either $4$ or $6$.

If the object took $4$ steps, then it must have gone two steps N and two steps E, in some permutation. There are $\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6$ ways for these four steps of occuring, and the probability is $\frac{6}{4^{4}}$.

If the object took $6$ steps, then it must have gone two steps N and two steps E, and an additional pair of moves that would cancel out, either N/S or W/E. The sequences N,N,N,E,E,S can be permuted in $\frac{6!}{3!2!1!} = 60$ ways. However, if the first four steps of the sequence are N,N,E,E in some permutation, it would have already reached the point $(2,2)$ in four moves. There are $\frac{4!}{2!2!}$ ways to order those four steps and $2!$ ways to determine the order of the remaining two steps, for a total of $12$ sequences that we have to exclude. This gives $60-12=48$ sequences of steps. There are the same number of sequences for the steps N,N,E,E,E,W, so the probability here is $\frac{2 \times 48}{4^6}$.

The total probability is $\frac{6}{4^4} + \frac{96}{4^6} = \frac{3}{64}$, and $m+n= \boxed{067}$.



## 1995 AIME Problem 4

Circles of radius $3$ and $6$ are externally tangent to each other and are internally tangent to a circle of radius $9$. The circle of radius $9$ has a chord that is a common external tangent of the other two circles. Find the square of the length of this chord.

Solution

We label the points as following: the centers of the circles of radii $3,6,9$ are $O_3,O_6,O_9$ respectively, and the endpoints of the chord are $P,Q$. Let $A_3,A_6,A_9$ be the feet of the perpendiculars from $O_3,O_6,O_9$ to $\overline{PQ}$ (so $A_3,A_6$ are the points of tangency). Then we note that $\overline{O_3A_3} \parallel \overline{O_6A_6} \parallel \overline{O_9A_9}$, and $O_6O_9 : O_9O_3 = 3:6 = 1:2$. Thus, $O_9A_9 = \frac{2 \cdot O_6A_6 + 1 \cdot O_3A_3}{3} = 5$ (consider similar triangles). Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to $\triangle O_9A_9P$, we find that $PQ^2 = 4(A_9P)^2 = 4[(O_9P)^2-(O_9A_9)^2] = 4[9^2-5^2] = \boxed{224}$

## 1995 AIME Problem 5

For certain real values of $a, b, c,$ and $d_{},$ the equation $x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0$ has four non-real roots. The product of two of these roots is $13+i$ and the sum of the other two roots is $3+4i,$ where $i=\sqrt{-1}.$ Find $b.$
Solution

Since the coefficients of the polynomial are real, it follows that the non-real roots must come in complex conjugate pairs. Let the first two roots be $m,n$. Since $m+n$ is not real, $m,n$ are not conjugates, so the other pair of roots must be the conjugates of $m,n$. Let $m'$ be the conjugate of $m$, and $n'$ be the conjugate of $n$. Then, $m\cdot n = 13 + i,m' + n' = 3 + 4i\Longrightarrow m'\cdot n' = 13 - i,m + n = 3 - 4i.$ By Vieta's formulas, we have that $b = mm' + nn' + mn' + nm' + mn + m'n' = (m + n)(m' + n') + mn + m'n' = \boxed{051}$.

## 1995 AIME Problem 6


Let $n=2^{31}3^{19}.$ How many positive integer divisors of $n^2$ are less than $n_{}$ but do not divide $n_{}$?
Solution 1

We know that $n^2 = 2^{62}3^{38}$ must have $(62+1)\times (38+1)$ factors by its prime factorization. If we group all of these factors (excluding $n$) into pairs that multiply to $n^2$, then one factor per pair is less than $n$, and so there are $\frac{63\times 39-1}{2} = 1228$ factors of $n^2$ that are less than $n$. There are $32\times20-1 = 639$ factors of $n$, which clearly are less than $n$, but are still factors of $n^2$. Therefore, there are $1228-639=\boxed{589}$ factors of $n$ that do not divide $n^2$.
Solution 2

Let $n=p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}$ for some prime $p_1,p_2$. Then $n^2$ has $\frac{(2k_1+1)(2k_2+1)-1}{2}$ factors less than $n$.

This simplifies to $\frac{4k_1k_2+2k_1+2k_2}{2}=2k_1k_2+k_1+k_2$.

The number of factors of $n$ less than $n$ is equal to $(k_1+1)(k_2+1)-1=k_1k_2+k_1+k_2$.

Thus, our general formula for $n=p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}$ is

Number of factors that satisfy the above $=(2k_1k_2+k_1+k_2)-(k_1k_2+k_1+k_2)=k_1k_2$

Incorporating this into our problem gives $19\times31=\boxed{589}$.


## 1995 AIME Problem 7


Given that $(1+\sin t)(1+\cos t)=5/4$ and

$(1-\sin t)(1-\cos t)=\frac mn-\sqrt{k},$

where $k, m,$ and $n_{}$ are positive integers with $m_{}$ and $n_{}$ relatively prime, find $k+m+n.$
Solution

From the givens, $2\sin t \cos t + 2 \sin t + 2 \cos t = \frac{1}{2}$, and adding $\sin^2 t + \cos^2t = 1$ to both sides gives $(\sin t + \cos t)^2 + 2(\sin t + \cos t) = \frac{3}{2}$. Completing the square on the left in the variable $(\sin t + \cos t)$ gives $\sin t + \cos t = -1 \pm \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}$. Since $|\sin t + \cos t| \leq \sqrt 2 < 1 + \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}$, we have $\sin t + \cos t = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} - 1$. Subtracting twice this from our original equation gives $(\sin t - 1)(\cos t - 1) = \sin t \cos t - \sin t - \cos t + 1 = \frac{13}{4} - \sqrt{10}$, so the answer is $13 + 4 + 10 = \boxed{027}$.
Solution 2

Let $(1 - \sin t)(1 - \cos t) = x$. Multiplying $x$ with the given equation, $\frac{5x}{4} = (1 - \sin^2 t)(1 - \cos^2 t) = \sin^2 t \cos ^2 t$, and $\frac{\sqrt{5x}}{2} = \sin t \cos t$. Simplifying and rearranging the given equation, $\sin t + \cos t = \frac{5}{4} - (\sin^2 t + \cos^2 t) - \sin t \cos t = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{5x}}{2}$. Notice that $(1 + \sin t)(1 + \cos t) - 2(\sin t + \cos t) = x$, and substituting, $x = \frac{5}{4} - 2( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{5x}}{2}) = \frac{3}{4} + \sqrt{5x}$. Rearranging and squaring, $5x = x^2 - \frac{3}{2} x + \frac{9}{16}$, so $x^2 - \frac{13}{2} x + \frac{9}{16} = 0$, and $x = \frac{13}{4} \pm \sqrt{10}$, but clearly, $0 \leq x < 4$. Therefore, $x = \frac{13}{4} - \sqrt{10}$, and the answer is $13 + 4 + 10 = \boxed{027}$.


## 1995 AIME Problem 8


For how many ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y),$ with $y<x\le 100,$ are both $\frac xy$ and $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ integers?
Solution 1

Since $y|x$, $y+1|x+1$, then $\text{gcd}\,(y,x)=y$ (the bars indicate divisibility) and $\text{gcd}\,(y+1,x+1)=y+1$. By the Euclidean algorithm, these can be rewritten respectively as $\text{gcd}\,(y,x-y)=y$ and $\text{gcd}\, (y+1,x-y)=y+1$, which implies that both $y,y+1 | x-y$. Also, as $\text{gcd}\,(y,y+1) = 1$, it follows that $y(y+1)|x-y$. [1]

Thus, for a given value of $y$, we need the number of multiples of $y(y+1)$ from $0$ to $100-y$ (as $x \le 100$). It follows that there are $\left\lfloor\frac{100-y}{y(y+1)} \right\rfloor$ satisfactory positive integers for all integers $y \le 100$. The answer is

$\sum_{y=1}^{99} \left\lfloor\frac{100-y}{y(y+1)} \right\rfloor = 49 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = \boxed{085}.$



^ Another way of stating this is to note that if $\frac{x}{y}$ and $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ are integers, then $\frac{x}{y} - 1 = \frac{x-y}{y}$ and $\frac{x+1}{y+1} - 1 = \frac{x-y}{y+1}$ must be integers. Since $y$ and $y+1$ cannot share common prime factors, it follows that $\frac{x-y}{y(y+1)}$ must also be an integer.
Solution 2

We know that $x \equiv 0 \mod y$ and $x+1 \equiv 0 \mod y+1$.

Write $x$ and $ky$ for some integer $k$. Then, $ky+1 \equiv 0\mod y+1$. We can add $k$ to each side in order to factor out a $y+1$. So, $ky+k+1 \equiv k \mod y+1$ or $k(y+1)+1 \equiv k \mod y+1$. We know that $k(y+1) \equiv 0 \mod y+1$. We finally achieve the congruence $1-k \equiv 0 \mod y+1$.

We can now write $k$ as $(y+1)a+1$. Plugging this back in, if we have a value for $y$, then $x = ky = ((y+1)a+1)y = y(y+1)a+y$. We only have to check values of $y$ when $y(y+1)<100$. This yields the equations $x = 2a+1, 6a+2, 12a+3, 20a+4, 30a+5, 42a+6, 56a+7, 72a+8, 90a+9$.

Finding all possible values of $a$ such that $y<x<100$, we get $49 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = \boxed{085}.$

## 1995 AIME Problem 9

Triangle $ABC$ is isosceles, with $AB=AC$ and altitude $AM=11.$ Suppose that there is a point $D$ on $\overline{AM}$ with $AD=10$ and $\angle BDC=3\angle BAC.$ Then the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ may be written in the form $a+\sqrt{b},$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers. Find $a+b.$

Solution 1

Let $x=\angle CAM$, so $3x=\angle CDM$. Then, $\frac{\tan 3x}{\tan x}=\frac{CM/1}{CM/11}=11$. Expanding $\tan 3x$ using the angle sum identity gives $\tan 3x=\tan(2x+x)=\frac{3\tan x-\tan^3x}{1-3\tan^2x}.$ Thus, $\frac{3-\tan^2x}{1-3\tan^2x}=11$. Solving, we get $\tan x= \frac 12$. Hence, $CM=\frac{11}2$ and $AC= \frac{11\sqrt{5}}2$ by the Pythagorean Theorem. The total perimeter is $2(AC + CM) = \sqrt{605}+11$. The answer is thus $a+b=\boxed{616}$.
Solution 2

In a similar fashion, we encode the angles as complex numbers, so if $BM=x$, then $\angle BAD=\text{Arg}(11+xi)$ and $\angle BDM=\text{Arg}(1+xi)$. So we need only find $x$ such that $\text{Arg}((11+xi)^3)=\text{Arg}(1331-33x^2+(363x-x^3)i)=\text{Arg}(1+xi)$. This will happen when $\frac{363x-x^3}{1331-33x^2}=x$, which simplifies to $121x-4x^3=0$. Therefore, $x=\frac{11}{2}$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $AB=\frac{11\sqrt{5}}{2}$, so the perimeter is $11+11\sqrt{5}=11+\sqrt{605}$, giving us our answer, $\boxed{616}$.

## 1995 AIME Problem 10

What is the largest positive integer that is not the sum of a positive integral multiple of $42$ and a positive composite integer?
Solution

The requested number $\mod {42}$ must be a prime number. Also, every number that is a multiple of $42$ greater than that prime number must also be prime, except for the requested number itself. So we make a table, listing all the primes up to $42$ and the numbers that are multiples of $42$ greater than them, until they reach a composite number.

| 2    | 44   |      |      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 3    | 45   |      |      |      |      |
| 5    | 47   | 89   | 131  | 173  | 215  |
| 7    | 49   |      |      |      |      |
| 11   | 53   | 95   |      |      |      |
| 13   | 55   |      |      |      |      |
| 17   | 59   | 101  | 143  |      |      |
| 19   | 61   | 103  | 145  |      |      |
| 23   | 65   |      |      |      |      |
| 29   | 71   | 113  | 155  |      |      |
| 31   | 73   | 115  |      |      |      |
| 37   | 79   | 121  |      |      |      |
| 41   | 83   | 125  |      |      |      |

$\boxed{215}$ is the greatest number in the list, so it is the answer. Note that considering $\mod {5}$ would have shortened the search, since $\text{gcd}(5,42)=1$, and so within $5$ numbers at least one must be divisible by $5$. 

## 1995 AIME Problem 11

A right rectangular prism $P_{}$ (i.e., a rectangular parallelpiped) has sides of integral length $a, b, c,$ with $a\le b\le c.$ A plane parallel to one of the faces of $P_{}$ cuts $P_{}$ into two prisms, one of which is similar to $P_{},$ and both of which have nonzero volume. Given that $b=1995,$ for how many ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ does such a plane exist?
Solution

Let $P'$ be the prism similar to $P$, and let the sides of $P'$ be of length $x,y,z$, such that $x \le y \le z$. Then

$\frac{x}{a} = \frac{y}{b} = \frac zc < 1.$

Note that if the ratio of similarity was equal to $1$, we would have a prism with zero volume. As one face of $P'$ is a face of $P$, it follows that $P$ and $P'$ share at least two side lengths in common. Since $x < a, y < b, z < c$, it follows that the only possibility is $y=a,z=b=1995$. Then,

$\frac{x}{a} = \frac{a}{1995} = \frac{1995}{c} \Longrightarrow ac = 1995^2 = 3^25^27^219^2.$

The number of factors of $3^25^27^219^2$ is $(2+1)(2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 81$. Only in $\left\lfloor \frac {81}2 \right\rfloor = 40$ of these cases is $a < c$ (for $a=c$, we end with a prism of zero volume). We can easily verify that these will yield nondegenerate prisms, so the answer is $\boxed{040}$.

The angle $\theta$ is the angle formed by two perpendiculars drawn to $BO$, one on the plane determined by $OAB$ and the other by $OBC$. Let the perpendiculars from $A$ and $C$ to $\overline{OB}$ meet $\overline{OB}$ at $P.$ Without loss of generality, let $AP = 1.$ It follows that $\triangle OPA$ is a $45-45-90$ right triangle, so $OP = AP = 1,$ $OB = OA = \sqrt {2},$ and $AB = \sqrt {4 - 2\sqrt {2}}.$ Therefore, $AC = \sqrt {8 - 4\sqrt {2}}.$

From the Law of Cosines, $AC^{2} = AP^{2} + PC^{2} - 2(AP)(PC)\cos \theta,$ so

$8 - 4\sqrt {2} = 1 + 1 - 2\cos \theta \Longrightarrow \cos \theta = - 3 + 2\sqrt {2} = - 3 + \sqrt{8}.$

Thus $m + n = \boxed{005}$.
Solution 2 (analytical/vectors)

Without loss of generality, place the pyramid in a 3-dimensional coordinate system such that $A = (1,0,0),$ $B = (0,1,0),$ $C = ( - 1,0,0),$ $D = (0, - 1,0),$ and $O = (0,0,z),$ where $z$ is unknown.

We first find $z.$ Note that

$\overrightarrow{OA}\cdot \overrightarrow{OB} = \parallel \overrightarrow{OA}\parallel \parallel \overrightarrow{OB}\parallel \cos 45^\circ.$

Since $\overrightarrow{OA} =\, <1,0, - z>$ and $\overrightarrow{OB} =\, <0,1, - z> ,$ this simplifies to

$z^{2}\sqrt {2} = 1 + z^{2}\implies z^{2} = 1 + \sqrt {2}.$

Now let's find $\cos \theta.$ Let $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ be normal vectors to the planes containing faces $OAB$ and $OBC,$ respectively. From the definition of the dot product as $\vec{u}\cdot \vec{v} = \parallel \vec{u}\parallel \parallel \vec{v}\parallel \cos \theta$, we will be able to solve for $\cos \theta.$ A cross product yields (alternatively, it is simple to find the equation of the planes $OAB$ and $OAC$, and then to find their normal vectors)

$\vec{u} = \overrightarrow{OA}\times \overrightarrow{OB} = \left| \begin{array}{ccc}\hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ 1 & 0 & - z \\ 0 & 1 & - z \end{array}\right| =\, < z,z,1 > .$

Similarly,

$\vec{v} = \overrightarrow{OB}\times \overrightarrow{OC} - \left|\begin{array}{ccc}\hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ 0 & 1 & - z \\ - 1 & 0 & - z \end{array}\right| =\, < - z,z,1 > .$

Hence, taking the dot product of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ yields

$\cos \theta = \frac{ \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} }{ \parallel \vec{u} \parallel \parallel \vec{v} \parallel } = \frac{- z^{2} + z^{2} + 1}{(\sqrt {1 + 2z^{2}})^{2}} = \frac {1}{3 + 2\sqrt {2}} = 3 - 2\sqrt {2} = 3 - \sqrt {8}.$

Flipping the signs (we found the cosine of the supplement angle) yields $\cos \theta = - 3 + \sqrt {8},$ so the answer is $\boxed{005}$.

Let $f(n)$ be the integer closest to $\sqrt[4]{n}.$ Find $\sum_{k=1}^{1995}\frac 1{f(k)}.$
Solution

When $\left(k - \frac {1}{2}\right)^4 < n < \left(k + \frac {1}{2}\right)^4$, then $f(n) = k$. Thus there are $\left \lfloor \left(k + \frac {1}{2}\right)^4 - \left(k - \frac {1}{2}\right)^4 \right\rfloor$ values of $n$ for which $f(n) = k$. Expanding using the binomial theorem,

$\begin{align*} \left(k + \frac {1}{2}\right)^4 - \left(k - \frac {1}{2}\right)^4 &= \left(k^4 + 2k^3 + \frac 32k^2 + \frac 12k + \frac 1{16}\right) - \left(k^4 - 2k^3 + \frac 32k^2 - \frac 12k + \frac 1{16}\right)\\ &= 4k^3 + k. \end{align*}$

Thus, $\frac{1}{k}$ appears in the summation $4k^3 + k$ times, and the sum for each $k$ is then $(4k^3 + k) \cdot \frac{1}{k} = 4k^2 + 1$. From $k = 1$ to $k = 6$, we get $\sum_{k=1}^{6} 4k^2 + 1 = 364 + 6 = 370$ (either adding or using the sum of consecutive squares formula).

But this only accounts for $\sum_{k = 1}^{6} (4k^3 + k) = 4\left(\frac{6(6+1)}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{6(6+1)}{2} = 1764 + 21 = 1785$ terms, so we still have $1995 - 1785 = 210$ terms with $f(n) = 7$. This adds $210 \cdot \frac {1}{7} = 30$ to our summation, giving ${400}$.

## 1995 AIME Problem 14

In a circle of radius $42$, two chords of length $78$ intersect at a point whose distance from the center is $18$. The two chords divide the interior of the circle into four regions. Two of these regions are bordered by segments of unequal lengths, and the area of either of them can be expressed uniquely in the form $m\pi-n\sqrt{d},$ where $m, n,$ and $d_{}$ are positive integers and $d_{}$ is not divisible by the square of any prime number. Find $m+n+d.$
Solution

Let the center of the circle be $O$, and the two chords be $\overline{AB}, \overline{CD}$ and intersecting at $E$, such that $AE = CE < BE = DE$. Let $F$ be the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$. Then $\overline{OF} \perp \overline{AB}$.

By the Pythagorean Theorem, $OF = \sqrt{OB^2 - BF^2} = \sqrt{42^2 - 39^2} = 9\sqrt{3}$, and $EF = \sqrt{OE^2 - OF^2} = 9$. Then $OEF$ is a $30-60-90$ right triangle, so $\angle OEB = \angle OED = 60^{\circ}$. Thus $\angle BEC = 60^{\circ}$, and by the Law of Cosines,
$BC^2 = BE^2 + CE^2 - 2 \cdot BE \cdot CE \cos 60^{\circ} = 42^2.$

It follows that $\triangle BCO$ is an equilateral triangle, so $\angle BOC = 60^{\circ}$. The desired area can be broken up into two regions, $\triangle BCE$ and the region bounded by $\overline{BC}$ and minor arc $\stackrel{\frown}{BC}$. The former can be found by Heron's formula to be $[BCE] = \sqrt{60(60-48)(60-42)(60-30)} = 360\sqrt{3}$. The latter is the difference between the area of sector $BOC$ and the equilateral $\triangle BOC$, or $\frac{1}{6}\pi (42)^2 - \frac{42^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} = 294\pi - 441\sqrt{3}$.

Thus, the desired area is $360\sqrt{3} + 294\pi - 441\sqrt{3} = 294\pi - 81\sqrt{3}$, and $m+n+d = \boxed{378}$.

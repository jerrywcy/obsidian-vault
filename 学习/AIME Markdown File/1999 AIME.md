## 1999 AIME Problem 1


Find the smallest prime that is the fifth term of an increasing arithmetic sequence, all four preceding terms also being prime.
Solution

Obviously, all of the terms must be odd. The common difference between the terms cannot be $2$ or $4$, since otherwise there would be a number in the sequence that is divisible by $3$. However, if the common difference is $6$, we find that $5,11,17,23$, and $29$ form an arithmetic sequence. Thus, the answer is $029$.
Alternate Solution

If we let the arithmetic sequence to be $p, p+a, p+2a, p+3a$, and $p+4a$, where $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is a positive integer, we can see that $p$ cannot be multiple of $2$ or $3$ or $4$. Smallest such prime number is $5$, and from a quick observation we can see that when $a$ is $6$, the terms of the sequence are all prime numbers. The sequence becomes $5, 11, 17, 23, 29$, so the answer is $029$.


## 1999 AIME Problem 2


Consider the parallelogram with vertices $(10,45)$, $(10,114)$, $(28,153)$, and $(28,84)$. A line through the origin cuts this figure into two congruent polygons. The slope of the line is $m/n,$ where $m_{}$ and $n_{}$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Solution
Solution 1

Let the first point on the line $x=10$ be $(10,45+a)$ where a is the height above $(10,45)$. Let the second point on the line $x=28$ be $(28, 153-a)$. For two given points, the line will pass the origin iff the coordinates are proportional (such that $\frac{y_1}{x_1} = \frac{y_2}{x_2}$). Then, we can write that $\frac{45 + a}{10} = \frac{153 - a}{28}$. Solving for $a$ yields that $1530 - 10a = 1260 + 28a$, so $a=\frac{270}{38}=\frac{135}{19}$. The slope of the line (since it passes through the origin) is $\frac{45 + \frac{135}{19}}{10} = \frac{99}{19}$, and the solution is $m + n = \boxed{118}$.
Solution 2

You can clearly see that a line that cuts a parallelogram into two congruent pieces must go through the center of the parallelogram. Taking the midpoint of $(10,45)$, and $(28,153)$ gives $(19,99)$, which is the center of the parallelogram. Thus the slope of the line must be $\frac{99}{19}$, and the solution is $\boxed{118}$.


## 1999 AIME Problem 3


Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ for which $n^2-19n+99$ is a perfect square.


Solution 1

If $n^2-19n+99=x^2$ for some positive integer $x$, then rearranging we get $n^2-19n+99-x^2=0$. Now from the quadratic formula,

$n=\frac{19\pm \sqrt{4x^2-35}}{2}$

Because $n$ is an integer, this means $4x^2-35=q^2$ for some nonnegative integer $q$. Rearranging gives $(2x+q)(2x-q)=35$. Thus $(2x+q, 2x-q)=(35, 1)$ or $(7,5)$, giving $x=3$ or $9$. This gives $n=1, 9, 10,$ or $18$, and the sum is $1+9+10+18=\boxed{38}$.
Solution 2

Suppose there is some $k$ such that $x^2 - 19x + 99 = k^2$. Completing the square, we have that $(x - 19/2)^2 + 99 - (19/2)^2 = k^2$, that is, $(x - 19/2)^2 + 35/4 = k^2$. Multiplying both sides by 4 and rearranging, we see that $(2k)^2 - (2x - 19)^2 = 35$. Thus, $(2k - 2x + 19)(2k + 2x - 19) = 35$. We then proceed as we did in the previous solution.


Solution 3

When $n \geq 12$, we have $(n-10)^2 < n^2 -19n + 99 < (n-8)^2.$

So if $n \geq 12$ and $n^2 -19n + 99$ is a perfect square, then $n^2 -19n + 99 = (n-9)^2$

or $n = 18$.

For $1 \leq n < 12$, it is easy to check that $n^2 -19n + 99$ is a perfect square when $n = 1, 9$ and $10$ ( using the identity $n^2 -19n + 99 = (n-10)^2 + n - 1.)$

We conclude that the answer is $1 + 9 + 10 + 18 = \boxed{38}.$


## 1999 AIME Problem 4

The two squares shown share the same center $O_{}$ and have sides of length 1. The length of $\overline{AB}$ is $43/99$ and the area of octagon $ABCDEFGH$ is $m/n,$ where $m_{}$ and $n_{}$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/8/8e/AIME_1999_Problem_4.png" height="150px" /></div>


Solution
Solution 1

Define the two possible distances from one of the labeled points and the corners of the square upon which the point lies as $x$ and $y$. The area of the octagon (by subtraction of areas) is $1 - 4\left(\frac{1}{2}xy\right) = 1 - 2xy$.

By the Pythagorean theorem, $x^2 + y^2 = \left(\frac{43}{99}\right)^2$

Also, 

$\begin{align*}x + y + \frac{43}{99} &= 1\\ x^2 + 2xy + y^2 &= \left(\frac{56}{99}\right)^2\end{align*}$

Substituting, 

$\begin{align*}\left(\frac{43}{99}\right)^2 + 2xy &= \left(\frac{56}{99}\right)^2 \\ 2xy = \frac{(56 + 43)(56 - 43)}{99^2} &= \frac{13}{99} \end{align*}$

Thus, the area of the octagon is $1 - \frac{13}{99} = \frac{86}{99}$, so $m + n = \boxed{185}$.
Solution 2

Each of the triangle $AOB$, $BOC$, $COD$, etc. are congruent, and their areas are $\frac{\frac{43}{99}\cdot\frac{1}{2}}{2}$, since the area of a triangle is $bh/2$, so the area of all $8$ of them is $\frac{86}{99}$ and the answer is $\boxed{185}$.


## 1999 AIME Problem 5

For any positive integer $x_{}$, let $S(x)$ be the sum of the digits of $x_{}$, and let $T(x)$ be $|S(x+2)-S(x)|.$ For example, $T(199)=|S(201)-S(199)|=|3-19|=16.$ How many values of $T(x)$ do not exceed 1999?
Solution

For most values of $x$, $T(x)$ will equal $2$. For those that don't, the difference must be bumping the number up a ten, a hundred, etc. If we take $T(a999)$ as an example, $|(a + 1) + 0 + 0 + 1 - (a + 9 + 9 + 9)| = |2 - 9(3)|$ And in general, the values of $T(x)$ will then be in the form of $|2 - 9n| = 9n - 2$. From $7$ to $1999$, there are $\left\lceil \frac{1999 - 7}{9}\right\rceil = 222$ solutions; including $2$ and there are a total of $\boxed{223}$ solutions.



## 1999 AIME Problem 6

A transformation of the first quadrant of the coordinate plane maps each point $(x,y)$ to the point $(\sqrt{x},\sqrt{y}).$ The vertices of quadrilateral $ABCD$ are $A=(900,300), B=(1800,600), C=(600,1800),$ and $D=(300,900).$ Let $k_{}$ be the area of the region enclosed by the image of quadrilateral $ABCD.$ Find the greatest integer that does not exceed $k_{}.$
Solution

$\begin{eqnarray*}A' = & (\sqrt {900}, \sqrt {300})\\ B' = & (\sqrt {1800}, \sqrt {600})\\ C' = & (\sqrt {600}, \sqrt {1800})\\ D' = & (\sqrt {300}, \sqrt {900}) \end{eqnarray*}$

First we see that lines passing through $AB$ and $CD$ have equations $y = \frac {1}{3}x$ and $y = 3x$, respectively. Looking at the points above, we see the equations for $A'B'$ and $C'D'$ are $y^2 = \frac {1}{3}x^2$ and $y^2 = 3x^2$, or, after manipulation $y = \frac {x}{\sqrt {3}}$ and $y = \sqrt {3}x$, respectively, which are still linear functions. Basically the square of the image points gives back the original points and we could plug them back into the original equation to get the equation of the image lines.

Now take a look at $BC$ and $AD$, which have the equations $y = - x + 2400$ and $y = - x + 1200$. The image equations hence are $x^2 + y^2 = 2400$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 1200$, respectively, which are the equations for circles.

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/e/e8/1999_AIME-6.png" height="200px" /></div>

To find the area between the circles (actually, parts of the circles), we need to figure out the angle of the arc. This could be done by $\arctan \sqrt {3} - \arctan \frac {1}{\sqrt {3}} = 60^\circ - 30^\circ = 30^\circ$. So the requested areas are the area of the enclosed part of the smaller circle subtracted from the area enclosed by the part of the larger circle = $\frac {30^\circ}{360^\circ}(R^2\pi - r^2\pi) = \frac {1}{12}(2400\pi - 1200\pi) = 100\pi$. Hence the answer is $\boxed{314}$.


## 1999 AIME Problem 7

There is a set of 1000 switches, each of which has four positions, called $A, B, C$, and $D$. When the position of any switch changes, it is only from $A$ to $B$, from $B$ to $C$, from $C$ to $D$, or from $D$ to $A$. Initially each switch is in position $A$. The switches are labeled with the 1000 different integers $(2^{x})(3^{y})(5^{z})$, where $x, y$, and $z$ take on the values $0, 1, \ldots, 9$. At step i of a 1000-step process, the $i$-th switch is advanced one step, and so are all the other switches whose labels divide the label on the $i$-th switch. After step 1000 has been completed, how many switches will be in position $A$?
Solution

For each $i$th switch (designated by $x_{i},y_{i},z_{i}$), it advances itself only one time at the $i$th step; thereafter, only a switch with larger $x_{j},y_{j},z_{j}$ values will advance the $i$th switch by one step provided $d_{i}= 2^{x_{i}}3^{y_{i}}5^{z_{i}}$ divides $d_{j}= 2^{x_{j}}3^{y_{j}}5^{z_{j}}$. Let $N = 2^{9}3^{9}5^{9}$ be the max switch label. To find the divisor multiples in the range of $d_{i}$ to $N$, we consider the exponents of the number $\frac{N}{d_{i}}= 2^{9-x_{i}}3^{9-y_{i}}5^{9-z_{i}}$. In general, the divisor-count of $\frac{N}{d}$ must be a multiple of 4 to ensure that a switch is in position A:
$4n = [(9-x)+1] [(9-y)+1] [(9-z)+1] = (10-x)(10-y)(10-z)$, where $0 \le x,y,z \le 9.$

We consider the cases where the 3 factors above do not contribute multiples of 4.

Case of no 2's:

The switches must be $(\mathrm{odd})(\mathrm{odd})(\mathrm{odd})$. There are $5$ odd integers in $0$ to $9$, so we have $5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125$ ways.

Case of a single 2:

The switches must be one of $(2\cdot \mathrm{odd})(\mathrm{odd})(\mathrm{odd})$ or $(\mathrm{odd})(2 \cdot \mathrm{odd})(\mathrm{odd})$ or $(\mathrm{odd})(\mathrm{odd})(2 \cdot \mathrm{odd})$.

Since $0 \le x,y,z \le 9,$ the terms $2\cdot 1, 2 \cdot 3,$ and $2 \cdot 5$ are three valid choices for the $(2 \cdot odd)$ factor above.

We have ${3\choose{1}} \cdot 3 \cdot 5^{2}= 225$ ways. 

The number of switches in position A is $1000-125-225 = \boxed{650}$.


## 1999 AIME Problem 8

Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the set of ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ of nonnegative real numbers that lie in the plane $x+y+z=1.$ Let us say that $(x,y,z)$ supports $(a,b,c)$ when exactly two of the following are true: $x\ge a, y\ge b, z\ge c.$ Let $\mathcal{S}$ consist of those triples in $\mathcal{T}$ that support $\left(\frac 12,\frac 13,\frac 16\right).$ The area of $\mathcal{S}$ divided by the area of $\mathcal{T}$ is $m/n,$ where $m_{}$ and $n_{}$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$
Solution

This problem just requires a good diagram and strong 3D visualization.

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/9/91/1999_AIME-8.png" height="200px" /></div>

The region in $(x,y,z)$ where $x \ge \frac{1}{2}, y \ge \frac{1}{3}$ is that of a little triangle on the bottom of the above diagram, of $y \ge \frac{1}{3}, z \ge \frac{1}{6}$ is the triangle at the right, and $x \ge \frac 12, z \ge \frac 16$ the triangle on the left, where the triangles are coplanar with the large equilateral triangle formed by $x+y+z=1,\ x,y,z \ge 0$. We can check that each of the three regions mentioned fall under exactly two of the inequalities and not the third.

1999 AIME-8a.png

The side length of the large equilateral triangle is $\sqrt{2}$, which we can find using 45-45-90 $\triangle$ with the axes. Using the formula $A = \frac{s^2\sqrt{3}}{4}$ for equilateral triangles, the area of the large triangle is $\frac{(\sqrt{2})^2\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Since the lines of the smaller triangles are parallel to those of the large triangle, by corresponding angles we see that all of the triangles are similar, so they are all equilateral triangles. We can solve for their side lengths easily by subtraction, and we get $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{6}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Calculating their areas, we get $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{18}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{72}$. The ratio $\frac{\mathcal{S}}{\mathcal{T}} = \frac{\frac{9\sqrt{3} + 4\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3}}{72}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{14}{36} = \frac{7}{18}$, and the answer is $m + n = \boxed{025}$.

To simplify the problem, we could used the fact that the area ratios are equal to the side ratios squared, and we get $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{14}{36} = \frac{7}{18}$.


## 1999 AIME Problem 9

A function $f$ is defined on the complex numbers by $f(z)=(a+bi)z,$ where $a_{}$ and $b_{}$ are positive numbers. This function has the property that the image of each point in the complex plane is equidistant from that point and the origin. Given that $|a+bi|=8$ and that $b^2=m/n,$ where $m_{}$ and $n_{}$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n.$

Solution 1

Suppose we pick an arbitrary point on the complex plane, say $(1,1)$. According to the definition of $f(z) = f(1+i) = (a+bi)(1+i) = (a-b) + (a+b)i$, this image must be equidistant to $(1,1)$ and $(0,0)$. Thus the image must lie on the line with slope $-1$ and which passes through $\left(\frac 12, \frac12\right)$, so its graph is $x + y = 1$. Substituting $x = (a-b)$ and $y = (a+b)$, we get $2a = 1 \Rightarrow a = \frac 12$.

By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + b^2 = 8^2 \Longrightarrow b^2 = \frac{255}{4}$, and the answer is $\boxed{259}$.
Solution 2

Plugging in $z=1$ yields $f(1) = a+bi$. This implies that $a+bi$ must fall on the line $Re(z)=a=\frac{1}{2}$, given the equidistant rule. By $|a+bi|=8$, we get $a^2 + b^2 = 64$, and plugging in $a=\frac{1}{2}$ yields $b^2=\frac{255}{4}$. The answer is thus $\boxed{259}$.
Solution 3

We are given that $(a + bi)z$ is equidistant from the origin and $z.$ This translates to $\begin{eqnarray*} |(a + bi)z - z| & = & |(a + bi)z| \\ |z(a - 1) + bzi| & = & |az + bzi| \\ |z||(a - 1) + bi| & = & |z||a + bi| \\ (a - 1)^2 + b^2 & = & a^2 + b^2 \\ & \Rightarrow & a = \frac 12 \end{eqnarray*}$ Sin

ce $|a + bi| = 8,$ $a^2 + b^2 = 64.$ But $a = \frac 12,$ thus $b^2 = \frac {255}4.$ So the answer is $259$.
Solution 4

Let $P$ and $Q$ be the points in the complex plane represented by $z$ and $(a+bi)z$, respectively. $|a+bi| = 8$ implies $OQ = 8OP$. Also, we are given $OQ = PQ$, so $OPQ$ is isosceles with base $OP$. Notice that the base angle of this isosceles triangle is equal to the argument $\theta$ of the complex number $a + bi$, because $(a+bi)z$ forms an angle of $\theta$ with $z$. Drop the altitude/median from $Q$ to base $OP$, and you end up with a right triangle that shows $\cos \theta = \frac{\frac{1}{2}OP}{8OQ} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}|z|}{8|z|} = \frac{1}{16}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $z$ lies in the first quadrant and $\theta < \pi/2$; hence by right triangle trigonometry $\sin \theta = \frac{\sqrt{255}}{16}$. Finally, $b = |a+bi|\sin\theta = 8\frac{\sqrt{255}}{16} = \frac{\sqrt{255}}{2}$, and $b^2 = \frac{255}{4}$, so the answer is $259$.


## 1999 AIME Problem 10

Ten points in the plane are given, with no three collinear. Four distinct segments joining pairs of these points are chosen at random, all such segments being equally likely. The probability that some three of the segments form a triangle whose vertices are among the ten given points is $m/n,$ where $m_{}$ and $n_{}$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$
Solution

First, let us find the number of triangles that can be formed from the 10 points. Since none of the points are collinear, it is possible to pick ${10\choose3}$ sets of 3 points which form triangles. However, a fourth distinct segment must also be picked. Since the triangle accounts for 3 segments, there are $45 - 3 = 42$ segments remaining.

The total number of ways of picking four distinct segments is ${45\choose4}$. Thus, the requested probability is $\frac{{10\choose3} \cdot 42}{{45\choose4}} = \frac{10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 42 \cdot 4!}{45 \cdot 44 \cdot 43 \cdot 42 \cdot 3!} = \frac{16}{473}$. The solution is $m + n = 489$.


## 1999 AIME Problem 11


Given that $\sum_{k=1}^{35}\sin 5k=\tan \frac mn,$ where angles are measured in degrees, and $m_{}$ and $n_{}$ are relatively prime positive integers that satisfy $\frac mn<90,$ find $m+n.$
Solution

Let $s = \sum_{k=1}^{35}\sin 5k = \sin 5 + \sin 10 + \ldots + \sin 175$. We could try to manipulate this sum by wrapping the terms around (since the first half is equal to the second half), but it quickly becomes apparent that this way is difficult to pull off. Instead, we look to telescope the sum. Using the identity $\sin a \sin b = \frac 12(\cos (a-b) - \cos (a+b))$, we can rewrite $s$ as

$s \cdot \sin 5 = \sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k \sin 5 = \sum_{k=1}^{35} \frac{1}{2}(\cos (5k - 5)- \cos (5k + 5))$ $s = \frac{0.5(\cos 0 - \cos 10 + \cos 5 - \cos 15 + \cos 10 - \cos 20 + \ldots - \cos 170 + \cos 165 - \cos 175+ \cos 170 - \cos 180)}{\sin 5}$

This telescopes to $s = \frac{\cos 0 + \cos 5 - \cos 175 - \cos 180}{2 \sin 5} = \frac{1 + \cos 5}{\sin 5}$. Manipulating this to use the identity $\tan x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{\sin 2x}$, we get $s = \frac{1 - \cos 175}{\sin 175} \Longrightarrow s = \tan \frac{175}{2}$, and our answer is $\boxed{177}$.
Alternate Solution

We note that $\sin x = \mbox{Im } e^{ix}$. We thus have that $\sum_{k = 1}^{35} \sin 5k$ $= \sum_{k = 1}^{35} \mbox{Im } e^{5ki}$ $= \mbox{Im } \sum_{k = 1}^{35} e^{5ki}$ $= \mbox{Im } \frac{e^{5i}(1 - e^{180i})}{2e^{5i}}$ $= \mbox{Im } \frac{2\cos5 + 2i \sin 5}{(1 - \cos 5) - i \sin 5}$ $= \mbox{Im } \frac{(2 \cos 5 + 2i \sin 5)((1 - \cos 5) + i \sin 5)}{(1 - \cos 5)^2 + \sin^2 5}$ $= \frac{2 \sin 5}{2 - 2 \cos 5} = \frac{\sin 5}{1 - \cos 5}$ $= \frac{\sin 175}{1 + \cos 175} = \tan \frac{175}{2}.$


The desired answer is thus $175 + 2 = \boxed{177}$.


## 1999 AIME Problem 12

The inscribed circle of triangle $ABC$ is tangent to $\overline{AB}$ at $P_{},$ and its radius is $21$. Given that $AP=23$ and $PB=27,$ find the perimeter of the triangle.

Solution

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/c/d/1/cd1d3a517ae3f4ddc9470481bb6e69b4808fbfaf.png" height="150px" /></div>

Solution 1

Let $Q$ be the tangency point on $\overline{AC}$, and $R$ on $\overline{BC}$. By the Two Tangent Theorem, $AP = AQ = 23$, $BP = BR = 27$, and $CQ = CR = x$. Using $rs = A$, where $s = \frac{27 \cdot 2 + 23 \cdot 2 + x \cdot 2}{2} = 50 + x$, we get $(21)(50 + x) = A$. By Heron's formula, $A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{(50+x)(x)(23)(27)}$. Equating and squaring both sides,

$\begin{eqnarray*} [21(50+x)]^2 &=& (50+x)(x)(621)\\ 441(50+x) &=& 621x\\ 180x = 441 \cdot 50 &\Longrightarrow & x = \frac{245}{2} \end{eqnarray*}$

We want the perimeter, which is $2s = 2\left(50 + \frac{245}{2}\right) = \boxed{345}$.
Solution 2

Let the incenter be denoted $I$. It is commonly known that the incenter is the intersection of the angle bisectors of a triangle. So let $\angle ABI = \angle CBI = \alpha, \angle BAI = \angle CAI = \beta,$ and $\angle BCI = \angle ACI = \gamma.$

We have that 

$\begin{eqnarray*} \tan \alpha & = & \frac {21}{27} \\ \tan \beta & = & \frac {21}{23} \\ \tan \gamma & = & \frac {21}x. \end{eqnarray*}$ S

o naturally we look at $\tan \gamma.$ But since $\gamma = \frac \pi2 - (\beta + \alpha)$ we have 

$\begin{eqnarray*} \tan \gamma & = & \tan\left(\frac \pi2 - (\beta + \alpha)\right) \\ & = & \frac 1{\tan(\alpha + \beta)} \\ \Rightarrow \frac {21}x & = & \frac {1 - \frac {21\cdot 21}{23\cdot 27}}{\frac {21}{27} + \frac {21}{23}} \end{eqnarray*}$ 

Doing the algebra, we get $x = \frac {245}2.$

The perimeter is therefore $2\cdot\frac {245}2 + 2\cdot 23 + 2\cdot 27 = \boxed{345}.$


## 1999 AIME Problem 13

Forty teams play a tournament in which every team plays every other team exactly once. No ties occur, and each team has a $50 \%$ chance of winning any game it plays. The probability that no two teams win the same number of games is $\frac mn,$ where $m_{}$ and $n_{}$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $\log_2 n.$
Solution

There are ${40 \choose 2} = 780$ total pairings of teams, and thus $2^{780}$ possible outcomes. In order for no two teams to win the same number of games, they must each win a different number of games. Since the minimum and maximum possible number of games won are 0 and 39 respectively, and there are 40 teams in total, each team corresponds uniquely with some $k$, with $0 \leq k \leq 39$, where $k$ represents the number of games the team won. With this in mind, we see that there are a total of $40!$ outcomes in which no two teams win the same number of games. Further, note that these are all the valid combinations, as the team with 1 win must beat the team with 0 wins, the team with 2 wins must beat the teams with 1 and 0 wins, and so on; thus, this uniquely defines a combination.


The desired probability is thus $\frac{40!}{2^{780}}$. We wish to simplify this into the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime. The only necessary step is to factor out all the powers of 2 from $40!$; the remaining number is clearly relatively prime to all powers of 2.


The number of powers of 2 in $40!$ is $\left \lfloor \frac{40}{2} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{40}{4} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{40}{8} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{40}{16} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{40}{32} \right \rfloor = 20 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 38.$


$780-38 = \boxed{742}$.


## 1999 AIME Problem 14

Point $P_{}$ is located inside triangle $ABC$ so that angles $PAB, PBC,$ and $PCA$ are all congruent. The sides of the triangle have lengths $AB=13, BC=14,$ and $CA=15,$ and the tangent of angle $PAB$ is $m/n,$ where $m_{}$ and $n_{}$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$

Solution

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/4/f/04fd050352e1902f94f601dda0ad620a7f5a4364.png" height="150px" /></div>

Let $BE = x, CF = y,$ and $AD = z$. We have that 

$\begin{align*}DP&=z\tan\theta\\ EP&=x\tan\theta\\ FP&=y\tan\theta\end{align*}$ 

We can then use the tool of calculating area in two ways $\begin{align*}[ABC]&=[PAB]+[PBC]+[PCA]\\ &=\frac{1}{2}(13)(z\tan\theta)+\frac{1}{2}(14)(x\tan\theta)+\frac{1}{2}(15)(y\tan\theta)\\ &=\frac{1}{2}\tan\theta(13z+14x+15y)\end{align*}$ 

On the other hand, 

$\begin{align*}[ABC]&=\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\\ &=\sqrt{21\cdot6\cdot7\cdot8}\\ &=84\end{align*}$ 

We still need $13z+14x+15y$ though. We have all these right triangles and we haven't even touched Pythagoras. So we give it a shot: 

$\begin{align}x^2+x^2\tan^2\theta&=z^2\tan^2\theta+(13-z)^2\\ z^2+z^2\tan^2\theta&=y^2\tan^2\theta+(15-y)^2\\ y^2+y^2\tan^2\theta&=x^2\tan^2\theta+(14-x)^2\end{align}$ 

Adding $(1) + (2) + (3)$ gives 

$\begin{align*}x^2+y^2+z^2&=(14-x)^2+(15-y)^2+(13-z)^2\\ \Rightarrow13z+14x+15y&=295\end{align*}$ 

Recall that we found that $[ABC]=\frac{1}{2}\tan\theta(13z+14x+15y)=84$. Plugging in $13z+14x+15y=295$, we get $\tan\theta=\frac{168}{295}$, giving us $\boxed{463}$ for an answer.
Solution 2

Let $AB=c$, $BC=a$, $AC=b$, $PA=x$, $PB=y$, and $PC=z$.

So by the Law of Cosines, we have: 

$\begin{align*}x^2 &= z^2 + b^2 - 2bz\cos{\theta}\\ y^2 &= x^2 + c^2 - 2cx\cos{\theta}\\ z^2 &= y^2 + a^2 - 2ay\cos{\theta}\end{align*}$ 

Adding these equations and rearranging, we have: $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (2bz + 2cx + 2ay)\cos{\theta}\qquad(1)$ Now $[CAP] + [ABP] + [BCP] = [ABC] = \sqrt {(21)(8)(7)(6)} = 84$, by Heron's formula.

Now the area of a triangle, $[A] = \frac {mn\sin{\beta}}{2}$, where $m$ and $n$ are sides on either side of an angle, $\beta$. So, 

$\begin{align*}[CAP] &= \frac {bz\sin{\theta}}{2}\\ [ABP] &= \frac {cx\sin{\theta}}{2}\\ [BCP] &= \frac {ay\sin{\theta}}{2}\end{align*}$ 

Adding these equations yields: 

$\begin{align*}[ABC]= 84 &= \frac {(bz + cx + ay)\sin{\theta}}{2}\\ \Rightarrow 168&= (bz + cx + ay)\sin{\theta}\qquad (2)\end{align*}$ 

Dividing $(2)$ by $(1)$, we have: 

$\begin{align*}\frac {168}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} &= \frac {(bz + cx + ay)\sin{\theta}}{(2bz + 2cx + 2ay)\cos{\theta}}\\ \Rightarrow \tan{\theta} = \frac {336}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} &= \frac {336}{14^2 + 15^2 + 13^2} = \frac {336}{590} = \frac {168}{295}\end{align*}$ 

Thus, $m + n = 168 + 295 = \boxed{463}$.

Let $D$, $E$, $F$ be the feet of the altitudes to sides $BC$, $CA$, $AB$, respectively, of $\triangle ABC$. The base of the tetrahedron is the orthocenter $O$ of the large triangle, so we just need to find that, then it's easy from there.

To find the coordinates of $O$, we need to find the intersection point of altitudes $BE$ and $AD$. The equation of $BE$ is simply $x=16$. $AD$ is perpendicular to line $BC$, so the slope of $AD$ is equal to the negative reciprocal of the slope of $BC$. $BC$ has slope $\frac{24-0}{16-34}=-\frac{4}{3}$, therefore $y=\frac{3}{4} x$. These two lines intersect at $(16,12)$, so that's the base of the height of the tetrahedron.

Let $S$ be the foot of altitude $BS$ in $\triangle BPQ$. From the Pythagorean Theorem, $h=\sqrt{BS^2-SO^2}$. However, since $S$ and $O$ are, by coincidence, the same point, $SO=0$ and $h=12$.

The area of the base is $102$, so the volume is $\frac{102*12}{3}=\boxed{408}$.
Alternate Solution 1

Consider the diagram provided in the previous solution. We first note that the medial triangle has coordinates $(17, 0, 0)$, $(8, 12, 0)$, and $(25, 12, 0)$. We can compute the area of this triangle as $102$. Suppose $(x, y, z)$ are the coordinates of the vertex of the resulting pyramid. Call this point $V$. Clearly, the height of the pyramid is $z$. The desired volume is thus $\frac{102z}{3} = 34z$.

We note that when folding the triangle to form the pyramid, some side lengths must stay the same. In particular, $VR = RA$, $VP = PB$, and $VQ = QC$. We then use distance formula to find the distances from $V$ to each of the vertices of the medial triangle. We thus arrive at a fairly simple system of equations, yielding $z = 12$. The desired volume is thus $34 \times 12 = \boxed{408}$.
Alternate Solution 2

The formed tetrahedron has pairwise parallel planar and oppositely equal length ($4\sqrt{13},15,17$) edges and can be inscribed in a parallelepiped (rectangular box) with the six tetrahedral edges as non-intersecting diagonals of the box faces. Let the edge lengths of the parallelepiped be $p,q,r$ and solve (by Pythagoras)

$p^2+q^2=4^2\cdot{13}$

$q^2+r^2=15^2$

$r^2+p^2=17^2$

to find that $(p^2,q^2,r^2)=(153,136,72)=(3^2\cdot{17},2^3\cdot{17},2^3\cdot{3^2}).$

Use the fact that the ratio of volumes between an inscribed tetrahedron and its circumscribing parallelepiped is $\tfrac{1}{3}$ and then the volume is

$\tfrac{1}{3}pqr=\tfrac{1}{3}\sqrt{2^6\cdot{3^4}\cdot{17^2}}=\boxed{408}$

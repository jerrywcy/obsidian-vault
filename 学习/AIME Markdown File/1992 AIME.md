## 1992 AIME Problem 1

Find the sum of all positive rational numbers that are less than 10 and that have denominator 30 when written in lowest terms.
Solution
Solution 1

There are 8 fractions which fit the conditions between 0 and 1: $\frac{1}{30},\frac{7}{30},\frac{11}{30},\frac{13}{30},\frac{17}{30},\frac{19}{30},\frac{23}{30},\frac{29}{30}$

Their sum is 4. Note that there are also 8 terms between 1 and 2 which we can obtain by adding 1 to each of our first 8 terms. For example, $1+\frac{19}{30}=\frac{49}{30}.$ Following this pattern, our answer is $4(10)+8(1+2+3+\cdots+9)=\boxed{400}.$
Solution 2

By Euler's Totient Function, there are $8$ numbers that are relatively prime to $30$, less than $30$. Note that they come in pairs $(m,30-m)$ which result in sums of $1$; thus the sum of the smallest $8$ rational numbers satisfying this is $\frac12\cdot8\cdot1=4$. Now refer to solution 1.

## 1992 AIME Problem 2

A positive integer is called ascending if, in its decimal representation, there are at least two digits and each digit is less than any digit to its right. How many ascending positive integers are there?
Solution

Note that an ascending number is exactly determined by its digits: for any set of digits (not including 0, since the only position for 0 is at the leftmost end of the number, i.e. a leading 0), there is exactly one ascending number with those digits.

So, there are nine digits that may be used: $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.$ Note that each digit may be present or may not be present. Hence, there are $2^9=512$ potential ascending numbers, one for each subset of $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.

However, we've counted one-digit numbers and the empty set, so we must subtract them off to get our answer, $512-10=\boxed{502}.$


## 1992 AIME Problem 3

A tennis player computes her win ratio by dividing the number of matches she has won by the total number of matches she has played. At the start of a weekend, her win ratio is exactly $.500$. During the weekend, she plays four matches, winning three and losing one. At the end of the weekend, her win ratio is greater than $.503$. What's the largest number of matches she could've won before the weekend began?
Solution

Let $n$ be the number of matches won, so that $\frac{n}{2n}=\frac{1}{2}$, and $\frac{n+3}{2n+4}>\frac{503}{1000}$. Cross multiplying, $1000n+3000>1006n+2012$, and $n<\frac{988}{6}$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{164}$.


## 1992 AIME Problem 4

In Pascal's Triangle, each entry is the sum of the two entries above it. In which row of Pascal's Triangle do three consecutive entries occur that are in the ratio $3: 4: 5$?
Solution

In Pascal's Triangle, we know that the binomial coefficients of the $n$th row are $\binom{n} {0}, \binom{n}{1}, ..., \binom{n} {n}$. Let our row be the $n$th row such that the three consecutive entries are $\binom{n} {r}$, $\binom{n}{r+1}$ and $\binom{n} {r+2}$.

After expanding and dividing one entry by another (to clean up the factorials), we see that $\frac 34=\frac{r+1}{n-r}$ and $\frac45=\frac{r+2}{n-r-1}$. Solving, $n = \boxed{062}$.


## 1992 AIME Problem 5

Let $S^{}_{}$ be the set of all rational numbers $r^{}_{}$, $0^{}_{}<r<1$, that have a repeating decimal expansion in the form $0.abcabcabc\ldots=0.\overline{abc}$, where the digits $a^{}_{}$, $b^{}_{}$, and $c^{}_{}$ are not necessarily distinct. To write the elements of $S^{}_{}$ as fractions in lowest terms, how many different numerators are required?
Solution

We consider the method in which repeating decimals are normally converted to fractions with an example:

$x=0.\overline{176}$

$\Rightarrow 1000x=176.\overline{176}$

$\Rightarrow 999x=1000x-x=176$

$\Rightarrow x=\frac{176}{999}$

Thus, let $x=0.\overline{abc}$

$\Rightarrow 1000x=abc.\overline{abc}$

$\Rightarrow 999x=1000x-x=abc$

$\Rightarrow x=\frac{abc}{999}$

If $abc$ is not divisible by $3$ or $37$, then this is in lowest terms. Let us consider the other multiples: $333$ multiples of $3$, $27$ of $37$, and $9$ of $3$ and $37$, so $999-333-27+9 = 648$, which is the amount that are neither. The $12$ numbers that are multiples of $81$ reduce to multiples of $3$. We have to count these since it will reduce to a multiple of $3$ which we have removed from $999$, but, this cannot be removed since the numerator cannot cancel the $3$.There aren't any numbers which are multiples of $37^2$, so we can't get numerators which are multiples of $37$. Therefore $648 + 12 = \boxed{660}$.


## 1992 AIME Problem 6

For how many pairs of consecutive integers in $\{1000,1001,1002,\ldots,2000\}$ is no carrying required when the two integers are added?
Solution
Solution 1

Consider what carrying means: If carrying is needed to add two numbers with digits $abcd$ and $efgh$, then $h+d\ge 10$ or $c+g\ge 10$ or $b+f\ge 10$. 6. Consider $c \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$. $1abc + 1ab(c+1)$ has no carry if $a, b \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$. This gives $5^3=125$ possible solutions.

With $c \in \{5, 6, 7, 8\}$, there obviously must be a carry. Consider $c = 9$. $a, b \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$ have no carry. This gives $5^2=25$ possible solutions. Considering $b = 9$, $a \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9\}$ have no carry. Thus, the solution is $125 + 25 + 6=\boxed{156}$.


Solution 2

Consider the ordered pair $(1abc , 1abc - 1)$ where $a,b$ and $c$ are digits. We are trying to find all ordered pairs where $(1abc) + (1abc - 1)$ does not require carrying. For the addition to require no carrying, $2a,2b < 10$, so $a,b < 5$ unless $1abc$ ends in $00$, which we will address later. Clearly, if $c \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5\}$, then adding $(1abc) + (1abc - 1)$ will require no carrying. We have $5$ possibilities for the value of $a$, $5$ for $b$, and $6$ for $c$, giving a total of $(5)(5)(6) = 150$, but we are not done yet.

We now have to consider the cases where $b,c = 0$, specifically when $1abc \in \{1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000\}$. We can see that $1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500$, and $2000$ all work, giving a grand total of $150 + 6 = \boxed{156}$ ordered pairs.


Solution 3

There are 3 forms possible. $1OOO$ : $5^3$ , $1OO9$ : $5^2$ , $1O99$ : $5^1$ , $1999$ : $5^0 or 1$ --- Thus, since there should be no carrying, in $O$ only integers $0$ to $4$ is possible Therefore, the answer is ${156}$




## 1992 AIME Problem 7

Faces $ABC^{}_{}$ and $BCD^{}_{}$ of tetrahedron $ABCD^{}_{}$ meet at an angle of $30^\circ$. The area of face $ABC^{}_{}$ is $120^{}_{}$, the area of face $BCD^{}_{}$ is $80^{}_{}$, and $BC=10^{}_{}$. Find the volume of the tetrahedron.
Solution

Since the area $BCD=80=\frac{1}{2}\cdot10\cdot16$, the perpendicular from D to BC has length 16.

The perpendicular from D to ABC is $16 \cdot \sin 30^\circ=8$. Therefore, the volume is $\frac{8\cdot120}{3}=\boxed{320}$.


## 1992 AIME Problem 8

For any sequence of real numbers $A=(a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots)$, define $\Delta A^{}_{}$ to be the sequence $(a_2-a_1,a_3-a_2,a_4-a_3,\ldots)$, whose $n^{\mbox{th}}_{}$ term is $a_{n+1}-a_n^{}$. Suppose that all of the terms of the sequence $\Delta(\Delta A^{}_{})$ are $1^{}_{}$, and that $a_{19}=a_{92}^{}=0$. Find $a_1^{}$.
Solution

Note that the $\Delta$s are reminiscent of differentiation; from the condition $\Delta(\Delta{A}) = 1$, we are led to consider the differential equation $\frac{d^2 A}{dn^2} = 1$ This inspires us to guess a quadratic with leading coefficient 1/2 as the solution; $a_{n} = \frac{1}{2}(n-19)(n-92)$ as we must have roots at $n = 19$ and $n = 92$.

Thus, $a_1=\frac{1}{2}(1-19)(1-92)=\boxed{819}$.
Solution 2

Let $\Delta^1 A=\Delta A$, and $\Delta^n A=\Delta(\Delta^{(n-1)}A)$.

Note that in every sequence of $a_i$, $a_n=\binom{n-1}{1}\Delta a_n + \binom{n-1}{2}\Delta^2 a_n +\binom{n-1}{3}\Delta^3 a_n + ...$

Then $a_n=a_1 +\binom{n-1}{1}\Delta a_1 +\binom{n-1}{2}\Delta^2 a_1 +\binom{n-1}{3}\Delta^3 a_1 + ...$

Since $\Delta a_1 =a_2 -a_1$, $a_n=a_1 +\binom{n-1}{1}(a_2-a_1) +\binom{n-1}{2}\cdot 1=a_1 +n(a_2-a_1) +\binom{n-1}{2}$

$a_{19}=0=a_1+18(a_2-a_1)+\binom{18}{2}=18a_2-17a_1+153$

$a_{92}=0=a_1+91(a_2-a_1)+\binom{91}{2}=91a_2-90a_1+4095$

Solving, $a_1=\boxed{819}$.
Solution 3

The sequence $\Delta(\Delta A)$ is the second finite difference sequence, and the first $k-1$ terms of this sequence can be computed in terms of the original sequence as shown below.

$\begin{array}{rcl} a_3+a_1-2a_2&=&1\\ a_4+a_2-2a_3&=&1\\ &\vdots\\ a_k + a_{k-2} - 2a_{k-1} &= &1\\ a_{k+1} + a_{k-1} - 2a_k &=& 1.\\ \end{array}$

Adding the above $k-1$ equations we find that

$(a_{k+1} - a_k) = k-1 + (a_2-a_1).\tag{1}$

We can sum equation $(1)$ from $k=1$ to $18$, finding $18(a_1-a_2) - a_1 = 153.\tag{2}$

We can also sum equation $(1)$ from $k=1$ to $91$, finding $91(a_1-a_2) - a_1 = 4095.\tag{3}$ Finally, $18\cdot (3) - 91\cdot(2)$ gives $a_1=\boxed{819}$.

## 1992 AIME Problem 9

Trapezoid $ABCD^{}_{}$ has sides $AB=92^{}_{}$, $BC=50^{}_{}$, $CD=19^{}_{}$, and $AD=70^{}_{}$, with $AB^{}_{}$ parallel to $CD^{}_{}$. A circle with center $P^{}_{}$ on $AB^{}_{}$ is drawn tangent to $BC^{}_{}$ and $AD^{}_{}$. Given that $AP^{}_{}=\frac mn$, where $m^{}_{}$ and $n^{}_{}$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n^{}_{}$.
Solution 1

Let $AB$ be the base of the trapezoid and consider angles $A$ and $B$. Let $x=AP$ and let $h$ equal the height of the trapezoid. Let $r$ equal the radius of the circle.

Then

$\sin{A}= \frac{r}{x} = \frac{h}{70}\qquad\text{ and }\qquad\sin{B}= \frac{r}{92-x} = \frac{h}{50}.\tag{1}$

Let $z$ be the distance along $AB$ from $A$ to where the perp from $D$ meets $AB$.

Then $h^2 +z^2 =70^2$ and $(73-z)^2 + h^2 =50^2$ so $h =\frac{\sqrt{44710959}}{146}$. We can substitute this into $(1)$ to find that $x= \frac{11753}{219} = \frac{161}{3}$ and $m+n = 164$.

Remark: One can come up with the equations in $(1)$ without directly resorting to trig. From similar triangles, $h/r = 70/x$ and $h/r = 50/ (92-x)$. This implies that $70/x =50/(92-x)$, so $x = 161/3$.
Solution 2

From $(1)$ above, $x = \frac{70r}{h}$ and $92-x = \frac{50r}{h}$. Adding these equations yields $92 = \frac{120r}{h}$. Thus, $x = \frac{70r}{h} = \frac{7}{12}\cdot\frac{120r}{h} = \frac{7}{12}\cdot92 = \frac{161}{3}$, and $m+n = \boxed{164}$.

We can use $(1)$ from Solution 1 to find that $h/r = 70/x$ and $h/r = 50/ (92-x)$.

This implies that $70/x =50/(92-x)$ so $x = 161/3$
Solution 3

Extend $AD$ and $BC$ to meet at a point $X$. Since $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel, $\triangle XCD ~ \triangle XAB$. If $AX$ is further extended to a point $A'$ and $XB$ is extended to a point $B'$ such that $A'B'$ is tangent to circle $P$, we discover that circle $P$ is the incircle of triangle $XA'B'$. Then line $XP$ is the angle bisector of $\angle AXB$. By homothety, $P$ is the intersection of the angle bisector of $\triangle XAB$ with $AB$. By the angle bisector theorem,

$\begin{align*} \frac{AX}{AP} &= \frac{XB}{BP}\\ \frac{AX}{AP} - \frac{XD}{AP} &= \frac{XB}{BP} - \frac{XC}{BP}\\ \frac{AD}{AP} &= \frac{BC}{BP}\\ &=\frac{7}{5} \end{align*}$

Let $7a = AP$, then $AB = 7a + 5a = 12a$. $AP = \frac{7}{12}(AB) = \frac{92\times 7}{12} = \frac{161}{3}$. Thus, $m + n = 164$.
Solution 4

The area of the trapezoid is $\frac{(19+92)h}{2}$, where $h$ is the height of the trapezoid.

Draw lines $CP$ and $BP$. We can now find the area of the trapezoid as the sum of the areas of the three triangles $BPC$, $CPD$, and $PBA$.

$[BPC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 50 \cdot r$ (where $r$ is the radius of the tangent circle.)

$[CPD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 19 \cdot h$

$[PBA] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 70 \cdot r$

$[BPC] + [CPD] + [PBA] = 60r + \frac{19h}{2} = [ABCD] = \frac{(19+92)h}{2}$

$60r = 46h$

$r = \frac{23h}{30}$

From Solution 1 above, $\frac{h}{70} = \frac{r}{x}$

Substituting $r = \frac{23h}{30}$, we find $x = \frac{161}{3}$, hence the answer is $\boxed{164}$.


## 1992 AIME Problem 10

Consider the region $A$ in the complex plane that consists of all points $z$ such that both $\frac{z}{40}$ and $\frac{40}{\overline{z}}$ have real and imaginary parts between $0$ and $1$, inclusive. What is the integer that is nearest the area of $A$?
Solution

Let $z=a+bi \implies \frac{z}{40}=\frac{a}{40}+\frac{b}{40}i$. Since $0\leq \frac{a}{40},\frac{b}{40}\leq 1$ we have the inequality $0\leq a,b \leq 40$which is a square of side length $40$.

Also, $\frac{40}{\overline{z}}=\frac{40}{a-bi}=\frac{40a}{a^2+b^2}+\frac{40b}{a^2+b^2}i$ so we have $0\leq a,b \leq \frac{a^2+b^2}{40}$, which leads to:$(a-20)^2+b^2\geq 20^2$ $a^2+(b-20)^2\geq 20^2$

We graph them:

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/1/1b/AIME_1992_Solution_10.png" height="150px" /></div>

We want the area outside the two circles but inside the square. Doing a little geometry, the area of the intersection of those three graphs is $40^2-\frac{40^2}{4}-\frac{1}{2}\pi 20^2\approx 571.68$

$\boxed{572}$


## 1992 AIME Problem 11

Lines $l_1^{}$ and $l_2^{}$ both pass through the origin and make first-quadrant angles of $\frac{\pi}{70}$ and $\frac{\pi}{54}$ radians, respectively, with the positive x-axis. For any line $l^{}_{}$, the transformation $R(l)^{}_{}$ produces another line as follows: $l^{}_{}$ is reflected in $l_1^{}$, and the resulting line is reflected in $l_2^{}$. Let $R^{(1)}(l)=R(l)^{}_{}$ and $R^{(n)}(l)^{}_{}=R\left(R^{(n-1)}(l)\right)$. Given that $l^{}_{}$ is the line $y=\frac{19}{92}x^{}_{}$, find the smallest positive integer $m^{}_{}$ for which $R^{(m)}(l)=l^{}_{}$.
Solution

Let $l$ be a line that makes an angle of $\theta$ with the positive $x$-axis. Let $l'$ be the reflection of $l$ in $l_1$, and let $l''$ be the reflection of $l'$ in $l_2$.

The angle between $l$ and $l_1$ is $\theta - \frac{\pi}{70}$, so the angle between $l_1$ and $l'$ must also be $\theta - \frac{\pi}{70}$. Thus, $l'$ makes an angle of $\frac{\pi}{70}-\left(\theta-\frac{\pi}{70}\right) = \frac{\pi}{35}-\theta$ with the positive $x$-axis.

Similarly, since the angle between $l'$ and $l_2$ is $\left(\frac{\pi}{35}-\theta\right)-\frac{\pi}{54}$, the angle between $l''$ and the positive $x$-axis is $\frac{\pi}{54}-\left(\left(\frac{\pi}{35}-\theta\right)-\frac{\pi}{54}\right) = \frac{\pi}{27}-\frac{\pi}{35}+\theta = \frac{8\pi}{945} + \theta$.

Thus, $R(l)$ makes an $\frac{8\pi}{945} + \theta$ angle with the positive $x$-axis. So $R^{(n)}(l)$ makes an $\frac{8n\pi}{945} + \theta$ angle with the positive $x$-axis.

Therefore, $R^{(m)}(l)=l$ iff $\frac{8m\pi}{945}$ is an integral multiple of $\pi$. Thus, $8m \equiv 0\mod{945}$. Since $\gcd(8,945)=1$, $m \equiv 0 \mod{945}$, so the smallest positive integer $m$ is $\boxed{945}$.


## 1992 AIME Problem 12

In a game of Chomp, two players alternately take bites from a 5-by-7 grid of unit squares. To take a bite, a player chooses one of the remaining squares, then removes ("eats") all squares in the quadrant defined by the left edge (extended upward) and the lower edge (extended rightward) of the chosen square. For example, the bite determined by the shaded square in the diagram would remove the shaded square and the four squares marked by $\times.$ (The squares with two or more dotted edges have been removed form the original board in previous moves.)

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/c/c6/AIME_1992_Problem_12.png" height="150px" /></div>

The object of the game is to make one's opponent take the last bite. The diagram shows one of the many subsets of the set of 35 unit squares that can occur during the game of Chomp. How many different subsets are there in all? Include the full board and empty board in your count.
Solution

By drawing possible examples of the subset, one can easily see that making one subset is the same as dividing the game board into two parts.

One can also see that it is the same as finding the shortest route from the upper left hand corner to the lower right hand corner; Such a route would require 5 lengths that go down, and 7 that go across, with the shape on the right "carved" out by the path a possible subset.

Therefore, the total number of such paths is $\binom{12}{5}=\boxed{792}$

## 1992 AIME Problem 13

Triangle $ABC$ has $AB=9$ and $BC: AC=40: 41$. What's the largest area that this triangle can have?
Solution
Solution 1

First, consider the triangle in a coordinate system with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(9,0)$, and $(a,b)$. Applying the distance formula, we see that $\frac{ \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} }{ \sqrt{ (a-9)^2 + b^2 } } = \frac{40}{41}$.

We want to maximize $b$, the height, with $9$ being the base.

Simplifying gives $-a^2 -\frac{3200}{9}a +1600 = b^2$.

To maximize $b$, we want to maximize $b^2$. So if we can write: $b^2=-(a+n)^2+m$, then $m$ is the maximum value of $b^2$ (this follows directly from the trivial inequality, because if ${x^2 \ge 0}$ then plugging in $a+n$ for $x$ gives us ${(a+n)^2 \ge 0}$).

$b^2=-a^2 -\frac{3200}{9}a +1600=-\left(a +\frac{1600}{9}\right)^2 +1600+\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right)^2$.

$\Rightarrow b\le\sqrt{1600+\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right)^2}=40\sqrt{1+\frac{1600}{81}}=\frac{40}{9}\sqrt{1681}=\frac{40\cdot 41}{9}$.

Then the area is $9\cdot\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{40\cdot 41}{9} = \boxed{820}$.
Solution 2

Let the three sides be $9,40x,41x$, so the area is $\frac14\sqrt {(81^2 - 81x^2)(81x^2 - 1)}$ by Heron's formula. By AM-GM, $\sqrt {(81^2 - 81x^2)(81x^2 - 1)}\le\frac {81^2 - 1}2$, and the maximum possible area is $\frac14\cdot\frac {81^2 - 1}2 = \frac18(81 - 1)(81 + 1) = 10\cdot82 = \boxed{820}$. This occurs when $81^2 - 81x^2 = 81x^2 - 1\implies x = \frac {4\sqrt {205}}9$.
Solution 3

Let $A, B$ be the endpoints of the side with length $9$. Let $\Gamma$ be the Apollonian Circle of $AB$ with ratio $40:41$; let this intersect $AB$ at $P$ and $Q$, where $P$ is inside $AB$ and $Q$ is outside. Then because $(A, B; P, Q)$ describes a harmonic set, $AP/AQ=BP/BQ\implies \frac{\frac{41}{9}}{BQ+9}=\frac{\frac{40}{9}}{BQ}\implies BQ=360$. Finally, this means that the radius of $\Gamma$ is $\frac{360+\frac{40}{9}}{2}=180+\frac{20}{9}$.

Since the area is maximized when the altitude to $AB$ is maximized, clearly we want the last vertex to be the highest point of $\Gamma$, which just makes the altitude have length $180+\frac{20}{9}$. Thus, the area of the triangle is $\frac{9\cdot \left(180+\frac{20}{9}\right)}{2}=\boxed{820}$


## 1992 AIME Problem 14

In triangle $ABC^{}_{}$, $A'$, $B'$, and $C'$ are on the sides $BC$, $AC^{}_{}$, and $AB^{}_{}$, respectively. Given that $AA'$, $BB'$, and $CC'$ are concurrent at the point $O^{}_{}$, and that $\frac{AO^{}_{}}{OA'}+\frac{BO}{OB'}+\frac{CO}{OC'}=92$, find $\frac{AO}{OA'}\cdot \frac{BO}{OB'}\cdot \frac{CO}{OC'}$.
Solution

Using mass points, let the weights of $A$, $B$, and $C$ be $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively.

Then, the weights of $A'$, $B'$, and $C'$ are $b+c$, $c+a$, and $a+b$ respectively.

Thus, $\frac{AO^{}_{}}{OA'} = \frac{b+c}{a}$, $\frac{BO^{}_{}}{OB'} = \frac{c+a}{b}$, and $\frac{CO^{}_{}}{OC'} = \frac{a+b}{c}$.

Therefore: $\frac{AO}{OA'}\cdot \frac{BO}{OB'}\cdot \frac{CO}{OC'} = \frac{b+c}{a} \cdot \frac{c+a}{b} \cdot \frac{a+b}{c}$ $= \frac{2abc+b^2c+bc^2+c^2a+ca^2+a^2b+ab^2}{abc} =$

$2+\frac{bc(b+c)}{abc}+\frac{ca(c+a)}{abc}+\frac{ab(a+b)}{abc} = 2 + \frac{b+c}{a} + \frac{c+a}{b} + \frac{a+b}{c}$ $= 2 + \frac{AO^{}_{}}{OA'}+\frac{BO}{OB'}+\frac{CO}{OC'} = 2+92 = \boxed{094}$.


## 1992 AIME Problem 15

Define a positive integer $n^{}_{}$ to be a factorial tail if there is some positive integer $m^{}_{}$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes. How many positive integers less than $1992$ are not factorial tails?
Solution

The number of zeros at the end of $m!$ is $f(m) = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{125} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{625} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{3125} \right\rfloor + \cdots$.

Note that if $m$ is a multiple of $5$, $f(m) = f(m+1) = f(m+2) = f(m+3) = f(m+4)$.

Since $f(m) \le \frac{m}{5} + \frac{m}{25} + \frac{m}{125} + \cdots = \frac{m}{4}$, a value of $m$ such that $f(m) = 1991$ is greater than $7964$. Testing values greater than this yields $f(7975)=1991$.

There are $\frac{7975}{5} = 1595$ distinct positive integers, $f(m)$, less than $1992$. Thus, there are $1991-1595 = \boxed{396}$ positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails.

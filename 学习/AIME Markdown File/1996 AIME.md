Solution

Let's make a table.

$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} {\text{Table}}\\\hline x&19&96\\\hline 1&a&b\\\hline c&d&e\\\hline \end{array}$

$\begin{eqnarray*} x+19+96=x+1+c\Rightarrow c=19+96-1=114,\\ 114+96+a=x+1+114\Rightarrow a=x-95 \end{eqnarray*}$

$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} {\text{Table in progress}}\\\hline x&19&96\\\hline 1&x-95&b\\\hline 114&d&e\\\hline \end{array}$

$\begin{eqnarray*}19+x-95+d=x+d-76=115+x\Rightarrow d=191,\\ 114+191+e=x+115\Rightarrow e=x-190 \end{eqnarray*}$ 

$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} {\text{Table in progress}}\\\hline x&19&96\\\hline 1&x-95&b\\\hline 114&191&x-190\\\hline \end{array}$

$3x-285=x+115\Rightarrow 2x=400\Rightarrow x=\boxed{200}$


## 1996 AIME Problem 2

For each real number $x$, let $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denote the greatest integer that does not exceed x. For how many positive integers $n$ is it true that $n<1000$ and that $\lfloor \log_{2} n \rfloor$ is a positive even integer?
Solution

For integers $k$, we want $\lfloor \log_2 n\rfloor = 2k$, or $2k \le \log_2 n < 2k+1 \Longrightarrow 2^{2k} \le n < 2^{2k+1}$. Thus, $n$ must satisfy these inequalities (since $n < 1000$):

$4\leq n <8$
$16\leq n<32$
$64\leq n<128$
$256\leq n<512$

There are $4$ for the first inequality, $16$ for the second, $64$ for the third, and $256$ for the fourth, so the answer is $4+16+64+256=\boxed{340}$.

## 1996 AIME Problem 3

Find the smallest positive integer $n$ for which the expansion of $(xy-3x+7y-21)^n$, after like terms have been collected, has at least 1996 terms.
Solution

Using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we rewrite as $[(x+7)(y-3)]^n = (x+7)^n(y-3)^n$. Both binomial expansions will contain $n+1$ non-like terms; their product will contain $(n+1)^2$ terms, as each term will have an unique power of $x$ or $y$ and so none of the terms will need to be collected. Hence $(n+1)^2 \ge 1996$, the smallest square after $1996$ is $2025 = 45^2$, so our answer is $45 - 1 = \boxed{044}$.

Alternatively, when $n = k$, the exponents of $x$ or $y$ in $x^i y^i$ can be any integer between $0$ and $k$ inclusive. Thus, when $n=1$, there are $(2)(2)$ terms and, when $n = k$, there are $(k+1)^2$ terms. Therefore, we need to find the smallest perfect square that is greater than $1996$. From trial and error, we get $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$. Thus, $k = 45$ --> $n = \boxed{044}$.


## 1996 AIME Problem 4

A wooden cube, whose edges are one centimeter long, rests on a horizontal surface. Illuminated by a point source of light that is $x$ centimeters directly above an upper vertex, the cube casts a shadow on the horizontal surface. The area of the shadow, which does not include the area beneath the cube is 48 square centimeters. Find the greatest integer that does not exceed $1000x$.
Solution

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/3/8/f38f9e17231436e2679268599eb5762cd8b20abd.png" height="200px" /></div>

(Figure not to scale) The area of the square shadow base is $48 + 1 = 49$, and so the sides of the shadow are $7$. Using the similar triangles in blue, $\frac {x}{1} = \frac {1}{6}$, and $\left\lfloor 1000x \right\rfloor = \boxed{166}$.


## 1996 AIME Problem 5

Suppose that the roots of $x^3+3x^2+4x-11=0$ are $a$, $b$, and $c$, and that the roots of $x^3+rx^2+sx+t=0$ are $a+b$, $b+c$, and $c+a$. Find $t$.
Solution

By Vieta's formulas on the polynomial $P(x) = x^3+3x^2+4x-11 = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c) = 0$, we have $a + b + c = s = -3$, $ab + bc + ca = 4$, and $abc = 11$. Then
$t = -(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = -(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) = -(-3-a)(-3-b)(-3-c)$

This is just the definition for $-P(-3) = \boxed{023}$.

Alternatively, we can expand the expression to get 

$\begin{align*} t &= -(-3-a)(-3-b)(-3-c)\\ &= (a+3)(b+3)(c+3)\\ &= abc + 3[ab + bc + ca] + 9[a + b + c] + 27\\ t &= 11 + 3(4) + 9(-3) + 27 = 23\end{align*}$


A third solution arises if it is seen that each term in the expansion of $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)$ has a total degree of 3. Another way to get terms with degree 3 is to multiply out $(a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca)$. Expanding both of these expressions and comparing them shows that:

$(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = (ab+bc+ca)(a+b+c)-abc$ $t = -(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = abc-(ab+bc+ca)(a+b+c) = 11-(4)(-3) = 23$


## 1996 AIME Problem 6

In a five-team tournament, each team plays one game with every other team. Each team has a $50\%$ chance of winning any game it plays. (There are no ties.) Let $\frac{m}{n}$ be the probability that the tournament will product neither an undefeated team nor a winless team, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m+n$.
Solution

We can use complementary counting: finding the probability that at least one team wins all games or at least one team loses all games.

No more than 1 team can win or lose all games, so at most one team can win all games and at most one team can lose all games.

Now we use PIE:

The probability that one team wins all games is $5\cdot (\frac{1}{2})^4=\frac{5}{16}$.

Similarity, the probability that one team loses all games is $\frac{5}{16}$.

The probability that one team wins all games and another team loses all games is $(5\cdot (\frac{1}{2})^4)(4\cdot (\frac{1}{2})^3)=\frac{5}{32}$.

$\frac{5}{16}+\frac{5}{16}-\frac{5}{32}=\frac{15}{32}$

Since this is the opposite of the probability we want, we subtract that from 1 to get $\frac{17}{32}$.

$17+32=\boxed{049}$


## 1996 AIME Problem 7

Two squares of a $7\times 7$ checkerboard are painted yellow, and the rest are painted green. Two color schemes are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by applying a rotation in the plane board. How many inequivalent color schemes are possible?
Solution

There are ${49 \choose 2}$ possible ways to select two squares to be painted yellow. There are four possible ways to rotate each board. Given an arbitrary pair of yellow squares, these four rotations will either yield two or four equivalent but distinct boards.

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/a/7/0a7f177933bf35411554393645ec7af860330930.png" height=”150px” /></div>

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/4/9/d/49db52d5f80493d2cb81be49d824eec51a15888b.png" height=”150px” /></div>

For most pairs, there will be
three other equivalent boards.	For those symmetric about the center,
there is only one other.

Note that a pair of yellow squares will only yield $2$ distinct boards upon rotation iff the yellow squares are rotationally symmetric about the center square; there are $\frac{49-1}{2}=24$ such pairs. There are then ${49 \choose 2}-24$ pairs that yield $4$ distinct boards upon rotation; in other words, for each of the ${49 \choose 2}-24$ pairs, there are three other pairs that yield an equivalent board.

Thus, the number of inequivalent boards is $\frac{{49 \choose 2} - 24}{4} + \frac{24}{2} = \boxed{300}$. For a $(2n+1) \times (2n+1)$ board, this argument generalizes to $n(n+1)(2n^2+2n+1)$ inequivalent configurations.


## 1996 AIME Problem 8

The harmonic mean of two positive integers is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of their reciprocals. For how many ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ with $x<y$ is the harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ equal to $6^{20}$?
Solution

The harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ is equal to $\frac{1}{\frac{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}}2} = \frac{2xy}{x+y}$, so we have $xy=(x+y)(3^{20}\cdot2^{19})$, and by SFFT, $(x-3^{20}\cdot2^{19})(y-3^{20}\cdot2^{19})=3^{40}\cdot2^{38}$. Now, $3^{40}\cdot2^{38}$ has $41\cdot39=1599$ factors, one of which is the square root ($3^{20}2^{19}$). Since $x<y$, the answer is half of the remaining number of factors, which is $\frac{1599-1}{2}= \boxed{799}$.


## 1996 AIME Problem 9


A bored student walks down a hall that contains a row of closed lockers, numbered $1$ to $1024$. He opens the locker numbered 1, and then alternates between skipping and opening each locker thereafter. When he reaches the end of the hall, the student turns around and starts back. He opens the first closed locker he encounters, and then alternates between skipping and opening each closed locker thereafter. The student continues wandering back and forth in this manner until every locker is open. What is the number of the last locker he opens?
Solution
Solution 1

On his first pass, he opens all of the odd lockers. So there are only even lockers closed. Then he opens the lockers that are multiples of $4$, leaving only lockers $2 \mod{8}$ and $6 \mod{8}$. Then he goes ahead and opens all lockers $2 \mod {8}$, leaving lockers either $6 \mod {16}$ or $14 \mod {16}$. He then goes ahead and opens all lockers $14 \mod {16}$, leaving the lockers either $6 \mod {32}$ or $22 \mod {32}$. He then goes ahead and opens all lockers $6 \mod {32}$, leaving $22 \mod {64}$ or $54 \mod {64}$. He then opens $54 \mod {64}$, leaving $22 \mod {128}$ or $86 \mod {128}$. He then opens $22 \mod {128}$ and leaves $86 \mod {256}$ and $214 \mod {256}$. He then opens all $214 \mod {256}$, so we have $86 \mod {512}$ and $342 \mod {512}$, leaving lockers $86, 342, 598$, and $854$, and he is at where he started again. He then opens $86$ and $598$, and then goes back and opens locker number $854$, leaving locker number $\boxed{342}$ untouched. He opens that locker.
Solution 2

We can also solve this with recursion. Let $L_n$ be the last locker he opens given that he started with $2^n$ lockers. Let there be $2^n$ lockers. After he first reaches the end of the hallway, there are $2^{n-1}$ lockers remaining. There is a correspondence between these unopened lockers and if he began with $2^{n-1}$ lockers. The locker $y$ (if he started with $2^{n-1}$ lockers) corresponds to the locker $2^n+2-2y$ (if he started with $2^n$ lockers). It follows that $L_{n} = 2^{n} +2 -2L_{n-1}$ as they are corresponding lockers. We can compute $L_1=2$ and use the recursion to find $L_{10}=\boxed{342}$


## 1996 AIME Problem 10


Find the smallest positive integer solution to $\tan{19x^{\circ}}=\frac{\cos{96^{\circ}}+\sin{96^{\circ}}}{\cos{96^{\circ}}-\sin{96^{\circ}}}$.
Solution

$\frac{\cos{96^{\circ}}+\sin{96^{\circ}}}{\cos{96^{\circ}}-\sin{96^{\circ}}} =$ $\frac{\sin{186^{\circ}}+\sin{96^{\circ}}}{\sin{186^{\circ}}-\sin{96^{\circ}}} =$ $\frac{\sin{(141^{\circ}+45^{\circ})}+\sin{(141^{\circ}-45^{\circ})}}{\sin{(141^{\circ}+45^{\circ})}-\sin{(141^{\circ}-45^{\circ})}} =$ $\frac{2\sin{141^{\circ}}\cos{45^{\circ}}}{2\cos{141^{\circ}}\sin{45^{\circ}}} = \tan{141^{\circ}}$.

The period of the tangent function is $180^\circ$, and the tangent function is one-to-one over each period of its domain.

Thus, $19x \equiv 141 \mod{180}$.

Since $19^2 \equiv 361 \equiv 1 \mod{180}$, multiplying both sides by $19$ yields $x \equiv 141 \cdot 19 \equiv (140+1)(18+1) \equiv 0+140+18+1 \equiv 159 \mod{180}$.

Therefore, the smallest positive solution is $x = \boxed{159}$.
Solution 2

$\frac{\cos{96^{\circ}}+\sin{96^{\circ}}}{\cos{96^{\circ}}-\sin{96^{\circ}}} = \frac{1 + \tan{96^{\circ}}}{1-\tan{96^{\circ}}}$ which is the same as $\frac{\tan{45^{\circ}} + \tan{96^{\circ}}}{1-\tan{45^{\circ}}\tan{96^{\circ}}}$ i.e. $\tan{141{^\circ}}$.

So $19x = 141 +180n$, for some integer $n$. Multiplying by $19$ gives $x \equiv 141 \cdot 19 \equiv 2679 \equiv 159 \mod{180}$. The smallest positive solution of this is $x = \boxed{159}$


## 1996 AIME Problem 11

Let $\mathrm {P}$ be the product of the roots of $z^6+z^4+z^3+z^2+1=0$ that have a positive imaginary part, and suppose that $\mathrm {P}=r(\cos{\theta^{\circ}}+i\sin{\theta^{\circ}})$, where $0<r$ and $0\leq \theta <360$. Find $\theta$.

Solution 1

$\begin{eqnarray*} 0 &=& z^6 - z + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = z(z^5 - 1) + \frac{z^5-1}{z-1}\\ 0 &=& \frac{(z^5 - 1)(z(z-1)+1)}{z-1} = \frac{(z^2-z+1)(z^5-1)}{z-1} \end{eqnarray*}$

Thus $z^5 = 1, z \neq 1 \Longrightarrow z = \mathrm{cis}\ 72, 144, 216, 288$,

or $z^2 - z + 1 = 0 \Longrightarrow z = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \mathrm{cis}\ 60, 300$

(see cis).

Discarding the roots with negative imaginary parts (leaving us with $\mathrm{cis} \theta,\ 0 < \theta < 180$), we are left with $\mathrm{cis}\ 60, 72, 144$; their product is $P = \mathrm{cis} (60 + 72 + 144) = \mathrm{cis} \boxed{276}$.
Solution 2

Let $w =$ the fifth roots of unity, except for $1$. Then $w^6 + w^4 + w^3 + w^2 + 1 = w^4 + w^3 + w^2 + w + 1 = 0$, and since both sides have the fifth roots of unity as roots, we have $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 | z^6 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + 1$. Long division quickly gives the other factor to be $z^2 - z + 1$. The solution follows as above.
Solution 3

Divide through by $z^3$. We get the equation $z^3 + \frac {1}{z^3} + z + \frac {1}{z} + 1 = 0$. Let $x = z + \frac {1}{z}$. Then $z^3 + \frac {1}{z^3} = x^3 - 3x$. Our equation is then $x^3 - 3x + x + 1 = x^3 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x - 1) = 0$, with solutions $x = 1, \frac { - 1\pm\sqrt {5}}{2}$. For $x = 1$, we get $z = \text{cis}60,\text{cis}300$. For $x = \frac { - 1 + \sqrt {5}}{2}$, we get $z = \text{cis}{72},\text{cis}{292}$ (using exponential form of $\cos$). For $x = \frac { - 1 - \sqrt {5}}{2}$, we get $z = \text{cis}144,\text{cis}216$. The ones with positive imaginary parts are ones where $0\le\theta\le180$, so we have $60 + 72 + 144 = \boxed{276}$.


## 1996 AIME Problem 12

For each permutation $a_1,a_2,a_3,\cdots,a_{10}$ of the integers $1,2,3,\cdots,10$, form the sum

$|a_1-a_2|+|a_3-a_4|+|a_5-a_6|+|a_7-a_8|+|a_9-a_{10}|.$

The average value of all such sums can be written in the form $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

Solution
Solution 1

Because of symmetry, we may find all the possible values for $|a_n - a_{n - 1}|$ and multiply by the number of times this value appears. Each occurs $5 \cdot 8!$, because if you fix $a_n$ and $a_{n + 1}$ there are still $8!$ spots for the others and you can do this $5$ times because there are $5$ places $a_n$ and $a_{n + 1}$ can be.

To find all possible values for $|a_n - a_{n - 1}|$ we have to compute 

$\begin{eqnarray*} |1 - 10| + |1 - 9| + \ldots + |1 - 2|\\ + |2 - 10| + \ldots + |2 - 3| + |2 - 1|\\ + \ldots\\ + |10 - 9| \end{eqnarray*}$

This is equivalent to

$2\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{9}\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{k}j = 330$

The total number of permutations is $10!$, so the average value is $\frac {330 \cdot 8! \cdot 5}{10!} = \frac {55}{3}$, and $m+n = \boxed{058}$.
Solution 2

Without loss of generality, let $a_1 > a_2;\, a_3 > a_4;\, \ldots ;\, a_9 > a_{10}$. We may do this because all sums obtained from these paired sequences are also obtained in another $2^5-1$ ways by permuting the adjacent terms $\{a_1,a_2\},\{a_3,a_4\}, \cdots , \{a_9, a_{10}\}$, and thus are canceled when the average is taken.

So now we only have to form the sum $S= (a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 + a_9) - (a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + a_{10})$. Due to the symmetry of this situation, we only need to compute the expected value of the result. $10$ must always be the greatest number in its pair; $9$ will be the greater number in its pair $\frac{8}{9}$ of the time and the lesser number $\frac 19$ of the time; $8$ will be the greater number in its pair $\frac 79$ of the time and the lesser $\frac 29$ of the time; and so forth. Each number either adds or subtracts from the sum depending upon whether it is one of the five greater or five lesser numbers in the pairs, respectively. Thus

$\begin{align*} \overline{S} &= 10 + \left(\frac{8}{9} \cdot 9\right) - \left(\frac{1}{9} \cdot 9\right) + \left(\frac{7}{9} \cdot 8\right) - \left(\frac 29 \cdot 8\right) + \cdots + \left(\frac{1}{9} \cdot 2\right) - \left(\frac{8}{9} \cdot 2\right) - 1 \\ &= \frac{9 \cdot 10 + 7 \cdot 9 + 5 \cdot 8 + 3 \cdot 7 + 1 \cdot 6 - 1 \cdot 5 - 3 \cdot 4 - 5 \cdot 3 - 7 \cdot 2 - 9 \cdot 1}{9} \\ &= \frac{55}{3} \end{align*}$

And the answer is $m+n = \boxed{058}$.
Solution 3

Similar to Solution 1, we can find the average value of $|a_2 - a_1|$, and multiply this by 5 due to symmetry. And again due to symmetry, we can arbitrarily choose $a_2 > a_1$. Thus there are $\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways to pick the two values of $a_2$ and $a_1$ from the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$ such that $a_2 > a_1$. First fix $a_2 = 10$, and vary $a_1$ from $1$ to $9$. Then fix $a_2 = 9$, and vary $a_1$ from $1$ to $8$. Continue, and you find that the sum of these $45$ ways to pick $|a_2 - a_1|$ is:

$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{9}\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{k}j = 45+36+28+21+15+10+6+3+1 = 165$.

Thus, each term contributes on average $\frac{165}{45}$, and the sum will be five times this, or $\frac{165}{9} = \frac{55}{3}$.

The final answer is $m+n = \boxed{058}$.


## 1996 AIME Problem 13


In triangle $ABC$, $AB=\sqrt{30}$, $AC=\sqrt{6}$, and $BC=\sqrt{15}$. There is a point $D$ for which $\overline{AD}$ bisects $\overline{BC}$, and $\angle ADB$ is a right angle. The ratio $\frac{[ADB]}{[ABC]}$ can be written in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Solution

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/e/9/7e995d2f972dad7f2aefe99478218d9c0a690451.png" height="150px" /></div>

Let $E$ be the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$. Since $BE = EC$, then $\triangle ABE$ and $\triangle AEC$ share the same height and have equal bases, and thus have the same area. Similarly, $\triangle BDE$ and $BAE$ share the same height, and have bases in the ratio $DE : AE$, so $\frac{[BDE]}{[BAE]} = \frac{DE}{AE}$ (see area ratios). Now,
$\frac{[ADB]}{[ABC]} = \frac{[ABE] + [BDE]}{2[ABE]} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{DE}{2AE}.$

By Stewart's Theorem, $AE = \frac{\sqrt{2(AB^2 + AC^2) - BC^2}}2 = \frac{\sqrt {57}}{2}$, and by the Pythagorean Theorem on $\triangle ABD, \triangle EBD$,

$\begin{align*} BD^2 + \left(DE + \frac {\sqrt{57}}2\right)^2 &= 30 \\ BD^2 + DE^2 &= \frac{15}{4} \\ \end{align*}$

Subtracting the two equations yields $DE\sqrt{57} + \frac{57}{4} = \frac{105}{4} \Longrightarrow DE = \frac{12}{\sqrt{57}}$. Then $\frac mn = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{DE}{2AE} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\frac{12}{\sqrt{57}}}{2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{57}}{2}} = \frac{27}{38}$, and $m+n = \boxed{065}$.


Solution 2

Because the problem asks for a ratio, we can divide each side length by $\sqrt{3}$ to make things simpler. We now have a triangle with sides $\sqrt{10}$, $\sqrt{5}$, and $\sqrt{2}$.

We use the same graph as above.

Draw perpendicular from $C$ to $AE$. Denote this point as $F$. We know that $DE = EF = x$ and $BD = CF = z$ and also let $AE = y$.

Using Pythagorean theorem, we get three equations,
$(y+x)^2 + z^2 = 10$

$(y-x)^2 + z^2 = 2$
$x^2 + z^2 = \frac{5}{4}$

Adding the first and second, we obtain $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 6$, and then subtracting the third from this we find that $y = \frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}$. (Note, we could have used Stewart's Theorem to achieve this result).

Subtracting the first and second, we see that $xy = 2$, and then we find that $x = \frac{4}{\sqrt{19}}$

Using base ratios, we then quickly find that the desired ratio is $\frac{27}{38}$ so our answer is $\boxed{065}$


## 1996 AIME Problem 14


A $150\times 324\times 375$ rectangular solid is made by gluing together $1\times 1\times 1$ cubes. An internal diagonal of this solid passes through the interiors of how many of the $1\times 1\times 1$ cubes?
Solution
Solution 1

Place one corner of the solid at $(0,0,0)$ and let $(a,b,c)$ be the general coordinates of the diagonally opposite corner of the rectangle, where $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z_{+}}$.

We consider the vector equation of the diagonal segment represented by: $(x, y, z) =m (a, b, c)$, where $m \in \mathbb{R}, 0 < m \le 1$.

Consider a point on the diagonal with coordinates $(ma, mb, mc)$. We have 3 key observations as this point moves from $(0,0,0)$ towards $(a,b,c)$:

When exactly one of $ma$, $mb$, $mc$ becomes a positive integer, the point crosses one of the faces of a $1 \times 1 \times 1$ cube from the outside to the inside of the cube.

When exactly two of $ma$, $mb$, $mc$ become positive integers, the point enters a new cube through one of the edges of the cube from the outside to the inside of the cube.

When all three $ma$, $mb$, $mc$ become positive integers, the point enters a cube through one of its vertices from the outside to the inside of the cube.


The number of cubes the diagonal passes is equal to the number of points on the diagonal that has one or more positive integers as coordinates.

If we slice the solid up by the $x$-planes defined by $x=1,2,3,4, \ldots, a$, the diagonal will cut these $x$-planes exactly $a$ times (plane of $x=0$ is not considered since $m \ne 0$). Similar arguments for slices along $y$-planes and $z$-planes give diagonal cuts of $b$, and $c$ times respectively. The total cuts by the diagonal is therefore $a+b+c$, if we can ensure that no more than $1$ positive integer is present in the x, y, or z coordinate in all points $(ma,mb,mc)$ on the diagonal. Note that point $(a,b,c)$ is already one such exception.

But for each diagonal point $(ma,mb,mc)$ with 2 (or more) positive integers occurring at the same time, $a+b+c$ counts the number of cube passes as $2$ instead of $1$ for each such point. There are $\gcd(a,b)+\gcd(b,c)+\gcd(c,a)$ points in such over-counting. We therefore subtract one time such over-counting from $a+b+c$.

And for each diagonal point $(ma,mb,mc)$ with exactly $3$ integers occurring at the same time, $a+b+c$ counts the number of cube passes as $3$ instead of $1$; ie $a+b+c$ over-counts each of such points by $2$. But since $\gcd(a,b)+\gcd(b,c)+\gcd(c,a)$ already subtracted three times for the case of $3$ integers occurring at the same time (since there are $3$ of these gcd terms that represent all combinations of 3 edges of a cube meeting at a vertex), we have the final count for each such point as $1 = 3-3+k \Rightarrow k=1$, where $k$ is our correction term. That is, we need to add $k=1$ time $\gcd(a,b,c)$ back to account for the case of 3 simultaneous integers.

Therefore, the total diagonal cube passes is: $D = a+b+c-\left[ \gcd(a,b)+\gcd(b,c)+\gcd(c,a) \right]+\gcd(a,b,c)$.

For $(a,b,c) = (150, 324, 375)$, we have: $\gcd(150,324)=6$, $\gcd(324,375)=3$, $\gcd(150,375)=75$, $\gcd(150,324,375)=3$.

Therefore $D = 150+324+375-(6+3+75)+3 = \boxed{768}$.
Solution 2

Consider a point travelling across the internal diagonal, and let the internal diagonal have a length of $d$. The point enters a new unit cube in the $x,y,z$ dimensions at multiples of $\frac{d}{150}, \frac{d}{324}, \frac{d}{375}$ respectively. We proceed by using PIE.

The point enters a new cube in the $x$ dimension $150$ times, in the $y$ dimension $324$ times and in the $z$ dimension, $375$ times.

The point enters a new cube in the $x$ and $y$ dimensions whenever a multiple of $\frac{d}{150}$ equals a multiple of $\frac{d}{324}$. This occurs $\gcd(150, 324)$ times. Similarly, a point enters a new cube in the $y,z$ dimensions $\gcd(324, 375)$ times and a point enters a new cube in the $z,x$ dimensions $\gcd(375, 150)$ times.

The point enters a new cube in the $x,y$ and $z$ dimensions whenever some multiples of $\frac{d}{150}, \frac{d}{324}, \frac{d}{375}$ are equal. This occurs $\gcd(150, 324, 375)$ times.

The total number of unit cubes entered is then $150+324+375-[\gcd(150, 324)+\gcd(324, 375)+\gcd(375, 150))] + \gcd(150, 324, 375) = \boxed{768}$


## 1996 AIME Problem 15

In parallelogram $ABCD$, let $O$ be the intersection of diagonals $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$. Angles $CAB$ and $DBC$ are each twice as large as angle $DBA$, and angle $ACB$ is $r$ times as large as angle $AOB$. Find the greatest integer that does not exceed $1000r$.

Solution
Solution 1 (trigonometry)

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/d/0/9/d09e1f91df6f1a2f004955349478e82b4cf67dad.png" height="150px" /></div>

Let $\theta = \angle DBA$. Then $\angle CAB = \angle DBC = 2\theta$, $\angle AOB = 180 - 3\theta$, and $\angle ACB = 180 - 5\theta$. Since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, it follows that $OA = OC$. By the Law of Sines on $\triangle ABO,\, \triangle BCO$,
$\frac{\sin \angle CBO}{OC} = \frac{\sin \angle ACB}{OB} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\sin \angle DBA}{OC} = \frac{\sin \angle BAC}{OB}.$

Dividing the two equalities yields

$\frac{\sin 2\theta}{\sin \theta} = \frac{\sin (180 - 5\theta)}{\sin 2\theta} \Longrightarrow \sin^2 2\theta = \sin 5\theta \sin \theta.$

Pythagorean and product-to-sum identities yield

$1 - \cos^2 2 \theta = \frac{\cos 4\theta - \cos 6 \theta}{2},$

and the double and triple angle ($\cos 3x = 4\cos^3 x - 3\cos x$) formulas further simplify this to

$4\cos^3 2\theta - 4\cos^2 2\theta - 3\cos 2\theta + 3 = (4\cos^2 2\theta - 3)(\cos 2\theta - 1) = 0$

The only value of $\theta$ that fits in this context comes from $4 \cos^2 2\theta - 3 = 0 \Longrightarrow \cos 2\theta = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \Longrightarrow \theta = 15^{\circ}$. The answer is $\lfloor 1000r \rfloor = \left\lfloor 1000 \cdot \frac{180 - 5\theta}{180 - 3\theta} \right\rfloor = \left \lfloor \frac{7000}{9} \right \rfloor = \boxed{777}$.
Solution 2 (trigonometry)

Define $\theta$ as above. Since $\angle CAB = \angle CBO$, it follows that $\triangle COB \sim \triangle CBA$, and so $\frac{CO}{BC} = \frac{BC}{AC} \Longrightarrow BC^2 = AC \cdot CO = 2CO^2 \Longrightarrow BC = CO\sqrt{2}$. The Law of Sines on $\triangle BOC$ yields that

$\frac{BC}{CO} = \frac{\sin (180-3\theta)}{\sin 2\theta} = \frac{\sin 3\theta}{\sin 2\theta} = \sqrt{2}$

Expanding using the sine double and triple angle formulas, we have

$2\sqrt {2} \sin \theta \cos \theta = \sin\theta( - 4\sin ^2 \theta + 3) \Longrightarrow \sin \theta\left(4\cos^2\theta - 2\sqrt {2} \cos \theta - 1\right) = 0.$

By the quadratic formula, we have $\cos \theta = \frac {2\sqrt {2} \pm \sqrt {8 + 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 4}}{8} = \frac {\sqrt {6} \pm \sqrt {2}}{4}$, so $\theta = 15^{\circ}$ (as the other roots are too large to make sense in context). The answer follows as above.
Solution 3

We will focus on $\triangle ABC$. Let $\angle ABO = x$, so $\angle BAO = \angle OBC = 2x$. Draw the perpendicular from $C$ intersecting $AB$ at $H$. Without loss of generality, let $AO = CO = 1$. Then $HO = 1$, since $O$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle AHC$. Then $\angle OHA = 2x$.

By the Exterior Angle Theorem, $\angle COB = 3x$ and $\angle COH = 4x$. That implies that $\angle HOB = x$. That makes $HO = HB = 1$. Then since by AA ($\angle HBC = \angle HOC = 3x$ and reflexive on $\angle OCB$), $\triangle OCB \sim \triangle BCA$.
$\frac {CO}{BC} = \frac {BC}{AC} \implies 2 = BC^2 = \implies BC = \sqrt {2}.$

Then by the Pythagorean Theorem, $1^2 + HC^2 = \left(\sqrt {2}\right)^2\implies HC = 1$. That makes $\triangle HOC$ equilateral. Then $\angle HOC = 4x = 60 \implies x = 15$. The answer follows as above.

## 1991 AIME Problem 1

Find $x^2+y^2$ if $x$ and $y$ are positive integers such that
$xy+x+y = 71$
$x^2y+xy^2 = 880.$

Solution
Solution 1

Define $a = x + y$ and $b = xy$. Then $a + b = 71$ and $ab = 880$. Solving these two equations yields a quadratic: $a^2 - 71a + 880 = 0$, which factors to $(a - 16)(a - 55) = 0$. Either $a = 16$ and $b = 55$ or $a = 55$ and $b = 16$. For the first case, it is easy to see that $(x,y)$ can be $(5,11)$ (or vice versa). In the second case, since all factors of $16$ must be $\le 16$, no two factors of $16$ can sum greater than $32$, and so there are no integral solutions for $(x,y)$. The solution is $5^2 + 11^2 = 146$.
Solution 2

Since $xy + x + y + 1 = 72$, this can be factored to $(x + 1)(y + 1) = 72$. As $x$ and $y$ are integers, the possible sets for $(x,y)$ (ignoring cases where $x > y$ since it is symmetrical) are $(1, 35),\ (2, 23),\ (3, 17),\ (5, 11),\ (7,8)$. The second equation factors to $(x + y)xy = 880 = 2^4 \cdot 5 \cdot 11$. The only set with a factor of $11$ is $(5,11)$, and checking shows that it is our solution. 

## 1991 AIME Problem 2

Rectangle $ABCD$ has sides $\overline {AB}$ of length 4 and $\overline {CB}$ of length 3. Divide $\overline {AB}$ into 168 congruent segments with points $A=P_0, P_1, \ldots, P_{168}=B$, and divide $\overline {CB}$ into 168 congruent segments with points $C=Q_0, Q_1, \ldots, Q_{168}=B$. For $1 \le k \le 167$, draw the segments $\overline {P_kQ_k}$. Repeat this construction on the sides $\overline {AD}$ and $\overline {CD}$, and then draw the diagonal $\overline {AC}$. Find the sum of the lengths of the 335 parallel segments drawn.

Solution

The length of the diagonal is $\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5$ (a 3-4-5 right triangle). For each $k$, $\overline{P_kQ_k}$ is the hypotenuse of a $3-4-5$ right triangle with sides of $3 \cdot \frac{k}{168}, 4 \cdot \frac{k}{168}$. Thus, its length is $5 \cdot \frac{k}{168}$. Let $a_k=\frac{5k}{168}$. We want to find $2\sum\limits_{k=1}^{168} a_k-5$ since we are over counting the diagonal. $2\sum\limits_{k=1}^{168} \frac{5k}{168}-5 =2\sum\limits_{k=0}^{168} \frac{5k}{168}-5 =2\frac{(0+5)\cdot169}{2}-5 =168\cdot5 =\boxed{840}$ 


## 1991 AIME Problem 3

Expanding $(1+0.2)^{1000}$ by the binomial theorem and doing no further manipulation gives

${1000 \choose 0}(0.2)^0+{1000 \choose 1}(0.2)^1+{1000 \choose 2}(0.2)^2+\cdots+{1000 \choose 1000}(0.2)^{1000}$ $= A_0 + A_1 + A_2 + \cdots + A_{1000},$ where $A_k = {1000 \choose k}(0.2)^k$ for $k = 0,1,2,\ldots,1000$. For which $k$ is $A_k^{}$ the largest?
Solution
Solution 1

Let $0<x<1$. Then we may write $A_{k}^{}={N\choose k}x^{k}=\frac{N!}{k!(N-k)!}x^{k}=\frac{(N-k+1)!}{k!}x^{k}$. Taking logarithms in both sides of this last equation and using the well-known fact $\log(ab)=\log a + \log b$ (valid if $a,b>0$), we have

$\log(A_{k})=\log\left[\frac{(N-k+1)!}{k!}x^{k}\right]=\log\left[\prod_{j=1}^{k}\frac{(N-j+1)x}{j}\right]=\sum_{j=1}^{k}\log\left[\frac{(N-j+1)x}{j}\right]\, .$

Now, $\log(A_{k}^{})$ keeps increasing with $k$ as long as the arguments $\frac{(N-j+1)x}{j}>1$ in each of the $\log\big[\;\big]$ terms (recall that $\log y <0$ if $0<y<1$). Therefore, the integer $k$ that we are looking for must satisfy $k=\Big\lfloor\frac{(N+1)x}{1+x}\Big\rfloor$, where $\lfloor z\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $z$.

In summary, substituting $N=1000$ and $x=0.2$ we finally find that $k=166$.
Solution 2

We know that once we have found the largest value of $k$, all values after $A_k$ are less than $A_k$. Therefore, we are looking for the largest possible value such that:

${\frac{1}{5}}^k\cdot {{1000} \choose {k}}>{\frac{1}{5}}^{k+1}\cdot {{1000} \choose {k+1}}$

Dividing by ${\frac{1}{5}}^k$ gives:

${1000\choose k}>{\frac{1}{5}}\cdot{1000\choose {k+1}}$.

We can express these binomial coefficients as factorials.

$\frac{1000!}{(1000-k)!\cdot(k)!}>{\frac{1}{5}}\cdot\frac{1000!}{(1000-k-1)!\cdot{(k+1)!}}$

We note that the $1000!$ can cancel. Also, $(1000-k)!=(1000-k)(1000-k-1)!$. Similarly, $(k+1)!=(k+1)k!$.

Canceling these terms yields,

$\frac{1}{(1000-k)}>{\frac{1}{5}}\cdot\frac{1}{(k+1)}$

Cross multiplying gives:

$5k+5>1000-k \Rightarrow k>165.8$

Therefore, since this identity holds for all values of $k>165.8$, the largest possible value of $k$ is $\boxed{166}$.
Solution 3

We know that $A_k$ will increase as $k$ increases until certain $k=m$, where $A_0 < A_1 < A_2 < \dots < A_{m-2} < A_{m-1} < A_m$ and

$A_m > A_{m+1} > A_{m+2} > \dots > A_{1000}.$

Next, to change $A_{k-1}$ to $A_k$, we multiply $A_{k-1}$ by $\frac{1000-k+1}{5k}$. It follows that the numerator must be greater than the

denominator or

$1000-k+1>5k$ $k<166.8$.

We conclude that the answer is $\boxed{166}$.


## 1991 AIME Problem 4

How many real numbers $x$ satisfy the equation $\frac{1}{5}\log_2 x = \sin (5\pi x)$?
Solution

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/f/f6/AIME_1991_Solution_04.png" height="200px" /></div>

The range of the sine function is $-1 \le y \le 1$. It is periodic (in this problem) with a period of $\frac{2}{5}$.

Thus, $-1 \le \frac{1}{5} \log_2 x \le 1$, and $-5 \le \log_2 x \le 5$. The solutions for $x$ occur in the domain of $\frac{1}{32} \le x \le 32$. When $x > 1$ the logarithm function returns a positive value; up to $x = 32$ it will pass through the sine curve. There are exactly 10 intersections of five periods (every two integral values of $x$) of the sine curve and another curve that is $< 1$, so there are $\frac{32}{2} \cdot 10 - 6 = 160 - 6 = 154$ values (the subtraction of 6 since all the “intersections” when $x < 1$ must be disregarded). When $y = 0$, there is exactly $1$ touching point between the two functions: $\left(\frac{1}{5},0\right)$. When $y < 0$ or $x < 1$, we can count $4$ more solutions. The solution is $154 + 1 + 4 = \boxed{159}$.


## 1991 AIME Problem 5

Given a rational number, write it as a fraction in lowest terms and calculate the product of the resulting numerator and denominator. For how many rational numbers between 0 and 1 will $20!$ be the resulting product?
Solution

If the fraction is in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, then $a < b$ and $gcd(a,b) = 1$. There are 8 prime numbers less than 20 ($2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19$), and each can only be a factor of one of $a$ or $b$. There are $2^8$ ways of selecting some combination of numbers for $a$; however, since $a<b$, only half of them will be between $0 < \frac{a}{b} < 1$. Therefore, the solution is $\frac{2^8}{2} = 128$.


## 1991 AIME Problem 6

Suppose $r$ is a real number for which
$\left\lfloor r + \frac{19}{100} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor r + \frac{20}{100} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor r + \frac{21}{100} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor r + \frac{91}{100} \right\rfloor = 546.$

Find $\lfloor 100r \rfloor$. (For real $x$, $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.)
Solution

There are $91 - 19 + 1 = 73$ numbers in the sequence. Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\lfloor r+\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\rfloor= \lfloor r+\frac{57}{100}\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \le r + \frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\frac{743}{100} \le r < \frac{744}{100}$, so $743\le 100r < 744$, and $\lfloor 100r \rfloor = 743$.


## 1991 AIME Problem 7

Find $A^2$, where $A$ is the sum of the absolute values of all roots of the following equation:
$x = \sqrt{19} + \frac{91}{{\sqrt{19}+\frac{91}{{\sqrt{19}+\frac{91}{{\sqrt{19}+\frac{91}{{\sqrt{19}+\frac{91}{x}}}}}}}}}$
Solution

Let $f(x) = \sqrt{19} + \frac{91}{x}$. Then $x = f(f(f(f(f(x)))))$, from which we realize that $f(x) = x$. This is because if we expand the entire expression, we will get a fraction of the form $\frac{ax + b}{cx + d}$ on the right hand side, which makes the equation simplify to a quadratic. As this quadratic will have two roots, they must be the same roots as the quadratic $f(x)=x$.

The given finite expansion can then be easily seen to reduce to the quadratic equation $x^{2}-\sqrt{19}x-91=0$. The solutions are $x_{\pm}=\frac{\sqrt{19}\pm\sqrt{383}}{2}$. Therefore, $A=\vert x_{+}\vert+\vert x_{-}\vert=\sqrt{383}$. We conclude that $A^{2}=383$.


## 1991 AIME Problem 8

For how many real numbers $a$ does the quadratic equation $x^2 + ax + 6a=0$ have only integer roots for $x$?

Solution
Solution 1

By Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = -a$ where $x_1, x_2$ are the roots of the quadratic, and since $x_1,x_2$ are integers, $a$ must be an integer. Applying the quadratic formula,

$x = \frac{-a \pm \sqrt{a^2 - 24a}}{2}$

Since $-a$ is an integer, we need $\sqrt{a^2-24a}$ to be an integer (let this be $b$): $b^2 = a^2 - 24a$. Completing the square, we get $(a - 12)^2 = b^2 + 144.$

Which implies that $b^2 + 144$ is a perfect square also (let this be $c^2$). Then $c^2 - b^2 = 144 \Rightarrow (c+b)(c-b) = 144$

The pairs of factors of $144$ are $(\pm1,\pm144),( \pm 2, \pm 72),( \pm 3, \pm 48),( \pm 4, \pm 36),( \pm 6, \pm 24),( \pm 8, \pm 18),( \pm 9, \pm 16),( \pm 12, \pm 12)$; since $c$ is the average of each respective pair and is also an integer, the pairs that work must have the same parity. Thus we get $\boxed{10}$ pairs (counting positive and negative) of factors that work, and substituting them backwards show that they all work.
Solution 2

Let $x^2 + ax + 6a = (x - s)(x - r)$. Vieta's yields $s + r = - a, sr = 6a$. 

$\begin{eqnarray*}sr + 6s + 6r &=& 0\\ sr + 6s + 6r + 36 &=& 36\\ (s + 6)(r + 6) &=& 36 \end{eqnarray*}$

Without loss of generality let $r \le s$.

The possible values of $(r + 6,s + 6)$ are: $( - 36, - 1),( - 18, - 2),( - 12, - 3),( - 9, - 4),( - 6, - 6),(1,36),(2,18),(3,12),(4,9),(6,6)$ $\Rightarrow \boxed{10}\ \text{values of } a$. 

## 1991 AIME Problem 9

Suppose that $\sec x+\tan x=\frac{22}7$ and that $\csc x+\cot x=\frac mn,$ where $\frac mn$ is in lowest terms. Find $m+n.$
Solution
Solution 1

Use the two trigonometric Pythagorean identities $1 + \tan^2 x = \sec^2 x$ and $1 + \cot^2 x = \csc^2 x$.

If we square the given $\sec x = \frac{22}{7} - \tan x$, we find that

$\begin{align*} \sec^2 x &= \left(\frac{22}7\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{22}7\right)\tan x + \tan^2 x \\ 1 &= \left(\frac{22}7\right)^2 - \frac{44}7 \tan x \end{align*}$

This yields $\tan x = \frac{435}{308}$.

Let $y = \frac mn$. Then squaring,

$\csc^2 x = (y - \cot x)^2 \Longrightarrow 1 = y^2 - 2y\cot x.$

Substituting $\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x} = \frac{308}{435}$ yields a quadratic equation: $0 = 435y^2 - 616y - 435 = (15y - 29)(29y + 15)$. It turns out that only the positive root will work, so the value of $y = \frac{29}{15}$ and $m + n = \boxed{044}$.
Solution 2

Recall that $\sec^2 x - \tan^2 x = 1$, from which we find that $\sec x - \tan x = 7/22$. Adding the equations

$\begin{eqnarray*} \sec x + \tan x & = & 22/7 \\ \sec x - \tan x & = & 7/22\end{eqnarray*}$

together and dividing by 2 gives $\sec x = 533/308$, and subtracting the equations and dividing by 2 gives $\tan x = 435/308$. Hence, $\cos x = 308/533$ and $\sin x = \tan x \cos x = (435/308)(308/533) = 435/533$. Thus, $\csc x = 533/435$ and $\cot x = 308/435$. Finally,

$\csc x + \cot x = \frac {841}{435} = \frac {29}{15},$

so $m + n = 044$.
Solution 3 (least computation)

By the given, $\frac {1}{\cos x} + \frac {\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac {22}{7}$ and $\frac {1}{\sin x} + \frac {\cos x}{\sin x} = k$.

Multiplying the two, we have

$\frac {1}{\sin x \cos x} + \frac {1}{\sin x} + \frac {1}{\cos x} + 1 = \frac {22}{7}k$

Subtracting both of the two given equations from this, and simpliyfing with the identity $\frac {\sin x}{\cos x} + \frac {\cos x}{\sin x} = \frac{\sin ^2 x + \cos ^2 x}{\sin x \cos x} = \frac {1}{\sin x \cos x}$, we get

$1 = \frac {22}{7}k - \frac {22}{7} - k.$

Solving yields $k = \frac {29}{15}$, and $m+n = 044$
Solution 4

Make the substitution $u = \tan \frac x2$ (a substitution commonly used in calculus). $\tan \frac x2 = \frac{\sin x}{1+\cos x}$, so $\csc x + \cot x = \frac{1+\cos x}{\sin x} = \frac1u = \frac mn$. $\sec x + \tan x = \frac{1 + \sin x}{\cos x}.$ Now note the following:

$\begin{align*}\sin x &= \frac{2u}{1+u^2}\\ \cos x &= \frac{1-u^2}{1+u^2}\end{align*}$

Plugging these into our equality gives:

$\frac{1+\frac{2u}{1+u^2}}{\frac{1-u^2}{1+u^2}} = \frac{22}7$

This simplifies to $\frac{1+u}{1-u} = \frac{22}7$, and solving for $u$ gives $u = \frac{15}{29}$, and $\frac mn = \frac{29}{15}$. Finally, $m+n = 044$.
Solution 5

We are given that $\frac{1+\sin x}{\cos x}=\frac{22}7\implies\frac{1+\sin x}{\cos x}\cdot\frac{1-\sin x}{1-\sin x}=\frac{1-\sin^2x}{\cos x(1-\sin x)}=\frac{\cos^2x}{\cos x(1-\sin x)}$ $=\frac{\cos x}{1-\sin x}$, or equivalently, $\cos x=\frac{7+7\sin x}{22}=\frac{22-22\sin x}7\implies\sin x=\frac{22^2-7^2}{22^2+7^2}$ $\implies\cos x=\frac{2\cdot22\cdot7}{22^2+7^2}$. Note that what we want is just $\frac{1+\cos x}{\sin x}=\frac{1+\frac{2\cdot22\cdot7}{22^2+7^2}}{\frac{22^2-7^2}{22^2+7^2}}=\frac{22^2+7^2+2\cdot22\cdot7}{22^2-7^2}=\frac{(22+7)^2}{(22-7)(22+7)}=\frac{22+7}{22-7}$ $=\frac{29}{15}\implies m+n=29+15=\boxed{044}$. 

## 1991 AIME Problem 10

Two three-letter strings, $aaa$ and $bbb$, are transmitted electronically. Each string is sent letter by letter. Due to faulty equipment, each of the six letters has a 1/3 chance of being received incorrectly, as an $a$ when it should have been a $b$, or as a $b$ when it should be an $a$. However, whether a given letter is received correctly or incorrectly is independent of the reception of any other letter. Let $S_a^{}$ be the three-letter string received when $aaa$ is transmitted and let $S_b^{}$ be the three-letter string received when $bbb$ is transmitted. Let $p$ be the probability that $S_a^{}$ comes before $S_b^{}$ in alphabetical order. When $p$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is its numerator?

Solution
Solution 1

Let us make a chart of values in alphabetical order, where $P_a,\ P_b$ are the probabilities that each string comes from $aaa$ and $bbb$ multiplied by $27$, and $S_b$ denotes the partial sums of $P_b$ (in other words, $S_b = \sum_{n=1}^{b} P_b$):

$\begin{array}{|r||r|r|r|} \hline \text{String}&P_a&P_b&S_b\\ \hline aaa & 8 & 1 & 1 \\ aab & 4 & 2 & 3 \\ aba & 4 & 2 & 5 \\ abb & 2 & 4 & 9 \\ baa & 4 & 2 & 11 \\ bab & 2 & 4 & 15 \\ bba & 2 & 4 & 19 \\ bbb & 1 & 8 & 27 \\ \hline \end{array}$

The probability is $p=\sum P_a \cdot (27 - S_b)$, so the answer turns out to be $\frac{8\cdot 26 + 4 \cdot 24 \ldots 2 \cdot 8 + 1 \cdot 0}{27^2} = \frac{532}{729}$, and the solution is $\boxed{532}$.
Solution 2

Let $S(a,n)$ be the $n$th letter of string $S(a)$. Compare the first letter of the string $S(a)$ to the first letter of the string $S(b)$. There is a $(2/3)^2=4/9$ chance that $S(a,1)$ comes before $S(b,1)$. There is a $2(1/3)(2/3)=4/9$ that $S(a,1)$ is the same as $S(b,1)$.

If $S(a,1)=S(b,1)$, then you do the same for the second letters of the strings. But you have to multiply the $4/9$ chance that $S(a,2)$ comes before $S(b,2)$ as there is a $4/9$ chance we will get to this step.

Similarly, if $S(a,2)=S(b,2)$, then there is a $(4/9)^3$ chance that we will get to comparing the third letters and that $S(a)$ comes before $S(b)$.

So we have $p=(4/9)+(4/9)^2+(4/9)^3=4/9+16/81+64/729=\boxed{532}/729$.
Solution 3

Consider $n$ letter strings instead. If the first letters all get transmitted correctly, then the $a$ string will be first. Otherwise, the only way is for both of the first letters to be the same, and then we consider the next $n-1$ letter string following the first letter. This easily leads to a recursion: $p_n=\frac23\cdot\frac23+2\cdot\frac23\cdot\frac13p_{n-1}=\frac49+\frac49p_{n-1}$. Clearly, $p_0=0\implies p_1=\frac49\implies p_2=\frac{52}{81}\implies p_3=\frac{\boxed{532}}{729}$. 

## 1991 AIME Problem 11

Twelve congruent disks are placed on a circle $C^{}_{}$ of radius 1 in such a way that the twelve disks cover $C^{}_{}$, no two of the disks overlap, and so that each of the twelve disks is tangent to its two neighbors. The resulting arrangement of disks is shown in the figure below. The sum of the areas of the twelve disks can be written in the from $\pi(a-b\sqrt{c})$, where $a,b,c^{}_{}$ are positive integers and $c^{}_{}$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b+c^{}_{}$.

Solution

We wish to find the radius of one circle, so that we can find the total area.

Notice that for them to contain the entire circle, each pair of circles must be tangent on the larger circle. Now consider two adjacent smaller circles. This means that the line connecting the radii is a segment of length $2r$ that is tangent to the larger circle at the midpoint of the two centers. Thus, we have essentially have a regular dodecagon whose vertices are the centers of the smaller triangles circumscribed about a circle of radius $1$.

We thus know that the apothem of the dodecagon is equal to $1$. To find the side length, we make a triangle consisting of a vertex, the midpoint of a side, and the center of the dodecagon, which we denote $A, M,$ and $O$ respectively. Notice that $OM=1$, and that $\triangle OMA$ is a right triangle with hypotenuse $OA$ and $m \angle MOA = 15^\circ$. Thus $AM = (1) \tan{15^\circ} = 2 - \sqrt {3}$, which is the radius of one of the circles. The area of one circle is thus $\pi(2 - \sqrt {3})^{2} = \pi (7 - 4 \sqrt {3})$, so the area of all $12$ circles is $\pi (84 - 48 \sqrt {3})$, giving an answer of $84 + 48 + 3 = \boxed{135}$.

Rhombus $PQRS$ is inscribed in rectangle $ABCD$ so that vertices $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are interior points on sides $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{CD}$, and $\overline{DA}$, respectively. It is given that $PB=15$, $BQ=20$, $PR=30$, and $QS=40$. Let $m/n$, in lowest terms, denote the perimeter of $ABCD$. Find $m+n$.

A drawer contains a mixture of red socks and blue socks, at most $1991$ in all. It so happens that, when two socks are selected randomly without replacement, there is a probability of exactly $\frac{1}{2}$ that both are red or both are blue. What is the largest possible number of red socks in the drawer that is consistent with this data?
Solution

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/b/a/5/ba5d2053ed60d0f7642922cfda4027d7224d527a.png" height="150px" /></div>

Solution 1

Let $O$ be the center of the rhombus. Via parallel sides and alternate interior angles, we see that the opposite triangles are congruent ($\triangle BPQ \cong \triangle DRS$, $\triangle APS \cong \triangle CRQ$). Quickly we realize that $O$ is also the center of the rectangle.

By the Pythagorean Theorem, we can solve for a side of the rhombus; $PQ = \sqrt{15^2 + 20^2} = 25$. Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors, we have that $OP = 15, OQ = 20$. Also, $\angle POQ = 90^{\circ}$, so quadrilateral $BPOQ$ is cyclic. By Ptolemy's Theorem, $25 \cdot OB = 20 \cdot 15 + 15 \cdot 20 = 600$.

By similar logic, we have $APOS$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. Let $AP = x$, $AS = y$. The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $x^2 + y^2 = 625\quad \mathrm{(1)}$. Ptolemy’s Theorem gives us $25 \cdot OA = 20x + 15y$. Since the diagonals of a rectangle are equal, $OA = \frac{1}{2}d = OB$, and $20x + 15y = 600\quad \mathrm{(2)}$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = 40 - \frac 43x$. Substituting into $\mathrm{(1)}$,

$\begin{eqnarray*}x^2 + \left(40-\frac 43x\right)^2 &=& 625\\ 5x^2 - 192x + 1755 &=& 0\\ x = \frac{192 \pm \sqrt{192^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 1755}}{10} &=& 15, \frac{117}{5}\end{eqnarray*}$

We reject $15$ because then everything degenerates into squares, but the condition that $PR \neq QS$ gives us a contradiction. Thus $x = \frac{117}{5}$, and backwards solving gives $y = \frac{44}5$. The perimeter of $ABCD$ is $2\left(20 + 15 + \frac{117}{5} + \frac{44}5\right) = \frac{672}{5}$, and $m + n = \boxed{677}$.
Solution 2

From above, we have $OB = 24$ and $BD = 48$. Returning to $BPQO,$ note that $\angle PQO\cong \angle PBO \cong ABD.$ Hence, $\triangle ABD \sim \triangle OQP$ by $AA$ similarity. From here, it's clear that 

$\frac {AD}{BD} = \frac {OP}{PQ}\implies \frac {AD}{48} = \frac {15}{25}\implies AD = \frac {144}{5}.$ Similarly, $\frac {AB}{BD} = \frac {IQ}{PQ}\implies \frac {AB}{48} = \frac {20}{25}\implies AB = \frac {192}{5}.$ Therefore, the perimeter of rectangle $ABCD$ is $2(AB + AD) = 2\left(\frac {192}{5} + \frac {144}{5}\right) = \frac {672}{5}.$
Solution 3

The triangles $QOB,OBC$ are isosceles, and similar (because they have $\angle QOB = \angle OBC$).

Hence $\frac {BQ}{OB} = \frac {OB}{BC} \Rightarrow OB^2 = BC \cdot BQ$.

The length of $OB$ could be found easily from the area of $BPQ$:

$BP \cdot BQ = \frac {OB}{2} \cdot PQ \Rightarrow OB = \frac {2BP\cdot BQ}{PQ} \Rightarrow OB = 24,$ $OB^2 = BC \cdot BQ \Rightarrow 24^2 = (20 + CQ) \cdot 20 \Rightarrow CQ = \frac {44}{5}$

From the right triangle $CRQ$ we have $RC^2 = 25^2 - \left(\frac {44}{5}\right)^2\Rightarrow RC = \frac {117}{5}$. We could have also defined a similar formula: $OB^2 = BP \cdot BA$, and then we found $AP$, the segment $OB$ is tangent to the circles with diameters $AO,CO$.

The perimeter is $2(PB + BQ + QC + CR) = 2\left(15 + 20 + \frac {44 + 117}{5}\right) = \frac {672}{5}\Rightarrow m+n=677$.
Solution 4

For convenience, let $\angle PQS = \theta$. Since the opposite triangles are congruent we have that $\angle BQR = 3\theta$, and therefore $\angle QRC = 3\theta - 90$. Let $QC = a$, then we have $\sin{(3\theta - 90)} = \frac {a}{25}$, or $- \cos{3\theta} = \frac {a}{25}$. Expanding with the formula $\cos{3\theta} = 4\cos^3{\theta} - 3\cos{\theta}$, and since we have $\cos{\theta} = \frac {4}{5}$, we can solve for $a$. The rest then follows similarily from above.
Solution 5

We can just find coordinates of the points. After drawing a picture, we can see 4 congruent right triangles with sides of $15,\ 20,\ 25$, namely triangles $DSR, OSR, OQP,$ and $BQP$.

Let the points of triangle $DSR$ be $(0,0)\ (0,20)\ (15,0)$. Let point $E$ be on $\overline{SR}$, such that $SE = 16$ and $ER = 9$. Triangle $DSR$ can be split into two similar 3-4-5 right triangles, $ESD$ and $EDR$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, point $D$ is $12$ away from point $E$. Repeating the process, if we break down triangle $DER$ into two more similar triangles, we find that point $E$ is at $(9.6, 7.2)$.

By reflecting point $D = (0,0)$ over point $E = (9.6, 7.2)$, we get point $O = (19.2, 14.4)$. By reflecting point $D$ over point $O$, we get point $B = (38.4, 28.8)$. Thus, the perimeter is equal to $(38.4 + 28.8)\times 2 = \frac {672}{5}$, making the final answer $672+5 = 677$. 

## 1991 AIME Problem 13

A drawer contains a mixture of red socks and blue socks, at most $1991$ in all. It so happens that, when two socks are selected randomly without replacement, there is a probability of exactly $\frac{1}{2}$ that both are red or both are blue. What is the largest possible number of red socks in the drawer that is consistent with this data?
Solution
Solution 1

Let $r$ and $b$ denote the number of red and blue socks, respectively. Also, let $t=r+b$. The probability $P$ that when two socks are drawn randomly, without replacement, both are red or both are blue is given by

$\frac{r(r-1)}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}+\frac{b(b-1)}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}=\frac{r(r-1)+(t-r)(t-r-1)}{t(t-1)}=\frac{1}{2}.$

Solving the resulting quadratic equation $r^{2}-rt+t(t-1)/4=0$, for $r$ in terms of $t$, one obtains that $r=\frac{t\pm\sqrt{t}}{2}\, .$

Now, since $r$ and $t$ are positive integers, it must be the case that $t=n^{2}$, with $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Hence, $r=n(n\pm 1)/2$ would correspond to the general solution. For the present case $t\leq 1991$, and so one easily finds that $n=44$ is the largest possible integer satisfying the problem conditions.

In summary, the solution is that the maximum number of red socks is $r=\boxed{990}$.
Solution 2

Let $r$ and $b$ denote the number of red and blue socks such that $r+b\le1991$. Then by complementary counting, the number of ways to get a red and a blue sock must be equal to $1-\frac12=\frac12=\frac{2rb}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}\implies4rb=(r+b)(r+b-1)$ $=(r+b)^2-(r+b)\implies r^2+2rb+b^2-r-b=4rb\implies r^2-2rb+b^2$ $=(r-b)^2=r+b$, so $r+b$ must be a perfect square $k^2$. Clearly, $r=\frac{k^2+k}2$, so the larger $k$, the larger $r$: $k^2=44^2$ is the largest perfect square below $1991$, and our answer is $\frac{44^2+44}2=\frac12\cdot44(44+1)=22\cdot45=11\cdot90=\boxed{990}$.

Solution 3

Let $r$ and $b$ denote the number of red and blue socks, respectively. In addition, let $t = r + b$, the total number of socks in the drawer.

From the problem, it is clear that $\frac{r(r-1)}{t(t-1)} + \frac{b(b-a)}{t(t-1)} = \frac{1}{2}$

Expanding, we get $\frac{r^2 + b^2 - r - b}{t^2 - t} = \frac{1}{2}$

Substituting $t$ for $r + b$ and cross multiplying, we get $2r^2 + 2b^2 - 2r - 2b = r^2 + 2br + b^2 - r - b$

Combining terms, we get $b^2 - 2br + r^2 - b - r = 0$

To make this expression factorable, we add $2r$ to both sides, resulting in $(b - r)^2 - 1(b-r) = (b - r - 1)(b - r) = 2r$

From this equation, we can test values for the expression $(b - r - 1)(b - r)$, which is the multiplication of two consecutive integers, until we find the highest value of $b$ or $r$ such that $b + r \leq 1991$.

By testing $(b - r - 1) = 43$ and $(b - r) = 44$, we get that $r = 43(22) = 946$ and $b = 990$. Testing values one integer higher, we get that $r = 990$ and $b = 1035$. Since $990 + 1035 = 2025$ is greater than $1991$, we conclude that $(946, 990)$ is our answer.

Since it doesn't matter whether the number of blue or red socks is $990$, we take the higher value for $r$, thus the maximum number of red socks is $r=\boxed{990}$.

Solution

Let $x=AC=BF$, $y=AD=BE$, and $z=AE=BD$.

Ptolemy's Theorem on $ABCD$ gives $81y+31\cdot 81=xz$, and Ptolemy on $ACDF$ gives $x\cdot z+81^2=y^2$. Subtracting these equations give $y^2-81y-112\cdot 81=0$, and from this $y=144$. Ptolemy on $ADEF$ gives $81y+81^2=z^2$, and from this $z=135$. Finally, plugging back into the first equation gives $x=105$, so $x+y+z=105+144+135=\boxed{384}$.

For positive integer $n$, define $S_n^{}$ to be the minimum value of the sum $\sum_{k=1}^n \sqrt{(2k-1)^2+a_k^2},$ where $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n^{}$ are positive real numbers whose sum is 17. There is a unique positive integer $n$ for which $S_n^{}$ is also an integer. Find this $n$.

Solution
Solution 1

Interpret the problem geometrically. Consider $n$ right triangles joined at their vertices, with bases $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ and heights $1,3,\ldots, 2n - 1$. The sum of their hypotenuses is the value of $S_n$. The minimum value of $S_n$, then, is the length of the straight line connecting the bottom vertex of the first right triangle and the top vertex of the last right triangle, so $S_n \ge \sqrt {\left(\sum_{k = 1}^n (2k - 1)\right)^2 + \left(\sum_{k = 1}^n a_k\right)^2}.$ Since the sum of the first $n$ odd integers is $n^2$ and the sum of $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ is 17, we get $S_n \ge \sqrt {17^2 + n^4}.$ If this is integer, we can write $17^2 + n^4 = m^2$, for an integer $m$. Thus, $(m - n^2)(m + n^2) = 289\cdot 1 = 17\cdot 17 = 1\cdot 289.$ The only possible value, then, for $m$ is $145$, in which case $n^2 = 144$, and $n = \boxed {012}$.
Solution 2

The inequality $S_n \ge \sqrt {\left(\sum_{k = 1}^n (2k - 1)\right)^2 + \left(\sum_{k = 1}^n a_k\right)^2}.$ is a direct result of the Minkowski Inequality. Continue as above.
Solution 3

Let $a_{i} = (2i - 1) \tan{\theta_{i}}$ for $1 \le i \le n$ and $0 \le \theta_{i} < \frac {\pi}{2}$. We then have that $S_{n} = \sum_{k = 1}^{n}\sqrt {(2k - 1)^{2} + a_{k}^{2}} = \sum_{k = 1}^{n}(2k - 1) \sec{\theta_{k}}$ Note that that $S_{n} + 17 = \sum_{k = 1}^{n}(2k - 1)(\sec{\theta_{k}} + \tan{\theta_{k}})$. Note that for any angle $\theta$, it is true that $\sec{\theta} + \tan{\theta}$ and $\sec{\theta} - \tan{\theta}$ are reciprocals. We thus have that $S_{n} - 17 = \sum_{k = 1}^{n}(2k - 1)(\sec{\theta_{k}} - \tan{\theta_{k}}) = \sum_{k = 1}^{n}\frac {2k - 1}{\sec{\theta_{k}} + \tan{\theta_{k}}}$. By the AM-HM inequality on these $n^{2}$ values, we have that: $\frac {S_{n} + 17}{n^{2}}\ge \frac {n^{2}}{S_{n} - 17}\rightarrow S_{n}^{2}\ge 289 + n^{4}$ This is thus the minimum value, with equality when all the tangents are equal. The only value for which $\sqrt {289 + n^{4}}$ is an integer is $n = 12$ (see above solutions for details).

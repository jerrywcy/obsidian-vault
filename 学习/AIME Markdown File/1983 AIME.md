## 1983 AIME Problem 1

Let $x$, $y$, and $z$ all exceed $1$, and let $w$ be a positive number such that $\log_x w = 24$, $\log_y w = 40$, and $\log_{xyz} w = 12$. Find $\log_z w$.
Solutions
Solution 1

The logarithmic notation doesn't tell us much, so we'll first convert everything to the equivalent exponential expressions.

$x^{24}=w$, $y^{40}=w$, and $(xyz)^{12}=w$. If we now convert everything to a power of $120$, it will be easy to isolate $z$ and $w$.

$x^{120}=w^5$, $y^{120}=w^3$, and $(xyz)^{120}=w^{10}$.

With some substitution, we get $w^5w^3z^{120}=w^{10}$ and $\log_zw=\boxed{060}$.
Solution 2

First we'll convert everything to exponential form. $x^{24}=w$, $y^{40}=w$, and $(xyz)^{12}=w$. The only expression with z is $(xyz)^{12}=w$. It now becomes clear one way to find $\log_z w$ is to find what $x^{12}$ and $y^{12}$ are in terms of $w$.

Taking the square root of the equation $x^{24}=w$ results in $x^{12}=w^{1/2}$. Taking the $12/40$ root of $y^{40}=w$ equates to $y^{12}=w^{3/10}$.

Going back to $(xyz)^{12}=w$, we can substitute the $x^{12}$ and $y^{12}$ with $w^{1/2}$ and $w^{3/10}$, respectively. We now have $w^{1/2}$*$w^{3/10}$*$z^{12}=w$. Simplify we get $z^{60}=w$. So our answer is $\boxed{060}$.
Solution 3

Applying the change of base formula, 

$\begin{align*} \log_x w = 24 &\implies \frac{\log w}{\log x} = 24 \implies \frac{\log x}{\log w} = \frac 1 {24} \\ \log_y w = 40 &\implies \frac{\log w}{\log y} = 40 \implies \frac{\log y}{\log w} = \frac 1 {40} \\ \log_{xyz} w = 12 &\implies \frac{\log {w}}{\log {xyz}} = 12 \implies \frac{\log x +\log y + \log z}{\log w} = \frac 1 {12} \end{align*}$ 

Therefore, $\frac {\log z}{\log w} = \frac 1 {12} - \frac 1 {24} - \frac 1{40} = \frac 1 {60}$. Hence, $\log_z w = \boxed{060}$.

## 1983 AIME Problem 2

Let $f(x)=|x-p|+|x-15|+|x-p-15|$, where $p \leq x \leq 15$. Determine the minimum value taken by $f(x)$ for $x$ in the interval $0 < x\leq15$.
Solution

It is best to get rid of the absolute value first.

Under the given circumstances, we notice that $|x-p|=x-p$, $|x-15|=15-x$, and $|x-p-15|=15+p-x$.

Adding these together, we find that the sum is equal to $30-x$, of which the minimum value is attained when $x=\boxed{015}$.

Edit: $|x-p-15|$ can equal $15+p-x$ or $x-p-15$ (for example, if $x=7$ and $p=-12$, $x-p-15=4$). Thus, our two "cases" are $30-x$ (if $x-p\leq15$) and $x-2p$ (if $x-p\geq15$). However, both of these cases give us $15$ as the minimum value for $f(x)$, which indeed is the answer posted above.


Also note the lowest value occurs when $x=p=15$ because this make the first two requirements $0$. It is easy then to check that 15 is the minimum value.


## 1983 AIME Problem 3

What is the product of the real roots of the equation $x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45}$?
Solutions
Solution 1

If we expand by squaring, we get a quartic polynomial, which isn't always the easiest thing to deal with.

Instead, we substitute $y$ for $x^2+18x+30$ and our equation becomes $y=2\sqrt{y+15}$.

Now we can square; solving for $y$, we get $y=10$ or $y=-6$ (The second solution is extraneous since $2\sqrt{y+15}$ is positive (plugging in $6$ as $y$, we get $-$6$ $=$ $6$, which is obviously not true)).So, we have $y=10$ as the only solution for $y$. Substituting $x^2+18x+30$ back in for $y$,
$x^2+18x+30=10 \Longrightarrow x^2+18x+20=0.$
By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is $\boxed{020}$.
Solution 2

We begin by noticing that the polynomial on the left is $15$ less than the polynomial under the radical sign. Thus: $(x^2+ 18 + 45) - 2\sqrt{x^2+18+45} - 15 = 0.$ Letting $n = \sqrt{x^2+18+45}$, we have $n^2-2n-15 = 0 \Longrightarrow (n-5)(n+3) = 0$. Because the square root of a real number can't be negative, the only possible $n$ is $5$.

Substituting that in, we have $\sqrt{x^2+18+45} = 5 \Longrightarrow x^2 + 18 + 45 = 25 \Longrightarrow x^2+18+20=0.$

And by Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is $\boxed{020}$.

A machine shop cutting tool is in the shape of a notched circle, as shown. The radius of the circle is $\sqrt{50}$ cm, the length of $AB$ is 6 cm, and that of $BC$ is 2 cm. The angle $ABC$ is a right angle. Find the square of the distance (in centimeters) from $B$ to the center of the circle.

Solution 1

Because we are given a right angle, we look for ways to apply the Pythagorean Theorem. Let the foot of the perpendicular from $O$ to $AB$ be $D$ and let the foot of the perpendicular from $O$ to the line $BC$ be $E$. Let $OE=x$ and $OD=y$. We're trying to find $x^2+y^2$.

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/0/5/005734c82fcbb09bb1717995c009ee75839e265e.png" height="150px" /></div>

Applying the Pythagorean Theorem, $OA^2 = OD^2 + AD^2$ and $OC^2 = EC^2 + EO^2$.

Thus, $(\sqrt{50})^2 = y^2 + (6-x)^2$, and $(\sqrt{50})^2 = x^2 + (y+2)^2$. We solve this system to get $x = 1$ and $y = 5$, resulting in $1^2 + 5^2 = \boxed{026}$.
Solution 2

Drop perpendiculars from $O$ to $AB$ ($T_1$), $M$ to $OT_1$ ($T_2$), and $M$ to $AB$ ($T_3$). Also, draw the midpoint $M$ of $AC$.

Then the problem is trivialized. Why?

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/e/c/8/ec8178dd6f1c58944b30643b6498df4a33724323.png" height="200px" /></div>

First notice that by computation, $OAC$ is a $\sqrt {50} - \sqrt {40} - \sqrt {50}$ isosceles triangle; thus $AC = MO$. Then, notice that $\angle MOT_2 = \angle T_3MO = \angle BAC$. Thus the two blue triangles are congruent.

So, $MT_2 = 2,OT_2 = 6$. As $T_3B = 3, MT_3 = 1$, we subtract and get $OT_1 = 5,T_1B = 1$. Then the Pythagorean Theorem shows $OB^2 = \boxed{026}$.


## 1983 AIME Problem 5

Suppose that the sum of the squares of two complex numbers $x$ and $y$ is $7$ and the sum of the cubes is $10$. What is the largest real value that $x + y$ can have?
Solution
Solution 1

One way to solve this problem seems to be by substitution.

$x^2+y^2=(x+y)^2-2xy=7$ and $x^3+y^3=(x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2)=(7-xy)(x+y)=10$

Because we are only left with $x+y$ and $xy$, substitution won't be too bad. Let $w=x+y$ and $z=xy$.

We get $w^2-2z=7$ and $w(7-z)=10$

Because we want the largest possible $w$, let's find an expression for $z$ in terms of $w$.

$w^2-7=2z \implies z=\frac{w^2-7}{2}$.

Substituting, $w^3-21w+20=0$. Factored, $(w-1)(w+5)(w-4)=0$ (the Rational Root Theorem may be used here, along with synthetic division)

The largest possible solution is therefore $x+y=w=\boxed{004}$.
Solution 2

An alternate way to solve this is to let $x=a+bi$ and $y=c+di$.

Because we are looking for a value of $x+y$ that is real, we know that $d=-b$, and thus $y=c-bi$.

Expanding $x^2+y^2=7+0i$ will give two equations, since the real and imaginary parts must match up.

$(a+bi)^2+(c-bi)^2=7+0i$

$(a^2+c^2-2b^2)+(2ab-2cb)i=7+0i$

Looking at the imaginary part of that equation, $2ab-2cb=0$, so $a=c$, and $x$ and $y$ are actually complex conjugates.

Looking at the real part of the equation and plugging in $a=c$, $2a^2-2b^2=7$, or $2b^2=2a^2-7$.

Now, evaluating the real part of $(a+bi)^3+(a-bi)^3$, which equals $10$ (ignoring the odd powers of $i$, since they would not result in something in the form of $10+0i$):

$a^3+3a(bi)^2+a^3+3a(-bi)^2=10$

$2a^3-6ab^2=10$

Since we know that $2b^2=2a^2-7$, it can be plugged in for $b^2$ in the above equation to yield:

$2a^3-3a(2a^2-7)=10$

$-4a^3+21a=10$

$4a^3-21a+10=0$

Since the problem is looking for $x+y=2a$ to be a positive integer, only positive half-integers (and whole-integers) need to be tested. From the Rational Roots theorem, $a=10, a=5, a=\frac{5}{2}$ all fail, but $a=2$ does work. Thus, the real part of both numbers is $2$, and their sum is $\boxed{004}$


Solution 3

Start by assuming x and y were roots of some polynomial of the form $w^2+bw+c$ So then $b^2-2c=7$ and $3bc-b^3=10$ Substituting $c=\frac{b^2-7}{2}$ we arrive at the polynomial $b^3-21b-20=0$ From rational root theorem we find the roots to be $-4,-1,5$ Since $-b$ is the sum of the roots and is maximized when b is -4, the answer is $-(-4)=\boxed{004}$


## 1983 AIME Problem 6

Let $a_n$ equal $6^{n}+8^{n}$. Determine the remainder upon dividing $a_ {83}$ by $49$.

Solution
Solution 1

First, we try to find a relationship between the numbers we're provided with and $49$. We realize that $49=7^2$ and both $6$ and $8$ are greater or less than $7$ by $1$.

Expressing the numbers in terms of $7$, we get $(7-1)^{83}+(7+1)^{83}$.

Applying the Binomial Theorem, half of our terms cancel out and we are left with $2(7^{83}+3403\cdot7^{81}+\cdots + 83\cdot7)$. We realize that all of these terms are divisible by $49$ except the final term.

After some quick division, our answer is $\boxed{035}$.
Solution 2

Since $\phi(49) = 42$ (the Euler's totient function), by Euler's Totient Theorem, $a^{42} \equiv 1 \mod{49}$ where $\text{gcd}(a,49) = 1$. Thus $6^{83} + 8^{83} \equiv 6^{2(42)-1}+8^{2(42)-1}$ $\equiv 6^{-1} + 8^{-1} \equiv \frac{8+6}{48}$ $\equiv \frac{14}{-1}\equiv \boxed{035} \mod{49}$.

Alternatively, we could have noted that $a^b\equiv a^{b\mod{\phi{(n)}}}\mod n$. This way, we have $6^{83}\equiv 6^{83\mod {42}}\equiv 6^{-1}\mod {49}$, and can finish the same way.



## 1983 AIME Problem 7

Twenty five of King Arthur's knights are seated at their customary round table. Three of them are chosen - all choices being equally likely - and are sent of to slay a troublesome dragon. Let $P$ be the probability that at least two of the three had been sitting next to each other. If $P$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and the denominator?

Solution
Solution 1

We can use Complementary counting by finding the probability that none are sitting next to each other and subtracting it from $1$.

Imagine the $22$ other (indistinguishable) people are already seated, and fixed into place.

We will place $A$, $B$, and $C$ with and without the restriction.

There are $22$ places to place $A$, followed by $21$ places to place $B$, and $20$ places to place $C$ after $A$ and $B$. Hence, there are $22\cdot21\cdot20$ ways to place $A, B, C$ in between these people with restrictions.

Without restrictions, there are $22$ places to place $A$, followed by $23$ places to place $B$, and $24$ places to place $C$ after $A$ and $B$. Hence, there are $22\cdot23\cdot24$ ways to place $A,B,C$ in between these people without restrictions.

Thus, the desired amount is $1-\frac{22\cdot21\cdot20}{22\cdot23\cdot24}=1-\frac{420}{552}=1-\frac{35}{46}=\frac{11}{46}$, and the answer is $11+46=\boxed{057}$.
Solution 2

There are $(25-1)! = 24!$ configurations for the knights about the table.

There are ${3\choose 2} = 3$ ways to pick a pair of knights from the trio, and there are $2! = 2$ ways to determine which order they are seated. Since these two knights must be attached, we let them be a single entity, so there are $(24-1)! = 23!$ configurations for the entities.

However, this overcounts the instances in which the trio sits together; when all three knights sit together, then two of the pairs from the previous case are counted. However, we only want to count this as one case, so we need to subtract the number of instances in which the trio sits together (as a single entity). There are $3! = 6$ ways to determine their order, and there are $(23-1)! = 22!$ configurations.

Thus, the answer is $\frac{2 \times 3 \times 23! - 6 \times 22!}{24!} = \frac{11}{46}$, and the answer is $\boxed{057}$.
Solution 3

Number the knights around the table 1-25. There are two possibilities: All three sit next to each other, or two sit next to each other and one is not sitting next to the other two.

Case 1: All three sit next to each other. In this case, you are picking $(1,2,3)$, $(2,3,4)$, $(4,5,6)$...$(25,1,2)$. This makes $25$ combinations.

Case 2: Like above, there are $25$ ways to pick the pair of knights sitting next to each other. Once a pair is picked, you cannot pick either of the two adjacent knights. (i.e. if you pick $(5,6)$, you may not pick 4 or 7). Thus, there are $25-4=21$ ways to pick the third knight, for a total of $25\cdot21$ combinations.

Thus, you have a total of $25 + (25\cdot21) = 25\cdot22$ allowable ways to pick the knights. The total number of ways to pick the knights is ${25\choose 3} = \frac{25\cdot24\cdot23}{3\cdot2\cdot1} = 25\cdot23\cdot4$.

The probability is $\frac{25\cdot22}{25\cdot23\cdot4} = \frac{11}{46}$, and the answer is $\boxed{057}$.
Solution 4

Pick an arbitrary spot for the first knight. Then pick spots for the next two knights in order.

Case 1: The second knight sits next to the first knight. There are 2 possible places for this out of 24, so the probability of this is $\frac{1}{12}$. We do not need to consider the third knight.

Case 2: The second knight sits two spaces from the first knight. There are 2 possible places for this out of 24, so the probability is $\frac{1}{12}$. Then there are 3 places out of a remaining 23 for the third knight to sit, so the total probability for this case is $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{3}{23}$

Case 3: The second knight sits 3 or more spaces from the first knight. There are 20 possible places for this out of 24, so the probability is $\frac{5}{6}$. Then there are four places to put the last knight out of 23, so the total probability for this case is $\frac{5}{6}\times\frac{4}{23}$

So add the probabilities to get the total:


$\frac{1}{12}+\frac{1}{12}\times\frac{3}{23}+\frac{5}{6}\times\frac{4}{23}=\frac{1}{12}\times\frac{1}{23}\left(23+3+40\right)=\frac{66}{12\times 23}$ $=\frac{6\times 11}{6\times 2 \times 23}=\frac{11}{46}\to\boxed{057}$




## 1983 AIME Problem 8

What is the largest 2-digit prime factor of the integer ${200\choose 100}$?
Solution

Expanding the binomial coefficient, we get ${200 \choose 100}=\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. Let the prime be $p$; then $10 \le p < 100$. If $p > 50$, then the factor of $p$ appears twice in the denominator. Thus, we need $p$ to appear as a factor three times in the numerator, or $3p<200$. The largest such prime is $\boxed{061}$, which is our answer.


## 1983 AIME Problem 9
Find the minimum value of $\frac{9x^2\sin^2 x + 4}{x\sin x}$ for $0 < x < \pi$.
Solution
Solution 1

Let $y=x\sin{x}$. We can rewrite the expression as $\frac{9y^2+4}{y}=9y+\frac{4}{y}$.

Since $x>0$ and $\sin{x}>0$ because $0< x<\pi$, we have $y>0$. So we can apply AM-GM:

$9y+\frac{4}{y}\ge 2\sqrt{9y\cdot\frac{4}{y}}=12$

The equality holds when $9y=\frac{4}{y}\Longleftrightarrow y^2=\frac49\Longleftrightarrow y=\frac23$.

Therefore, the minimum value is $\boxed{012}$. This is reached when plugging in $2/3$ for $xsinx$ in the original equation (when $x\sin{x}=\frac23$; since $x\sin x$ is continuous and increasing on the interval $0 \le x \le \frac{\pi}{2}$ and its range on that interval is from $0 \le x\sin x \le \frac{\pi}{2}$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem this value is attainable).
Solution 2

We can rewrite the numerator to be a perfect square by adding $-\frac{12x \sin x}{x \sin x}$. Thus, we must also add back $12$.

This results in $\frac{(3x \sin x-2)^2}{x \sin x}+12$.

Thus, if $3x \sin x-2=0$, then the minimum is obviously $12$. We show this possible with the same methods in Solution 1; thus the answer is $\boxed{012}$.
Solution 3

Let $y = x\sin{x}$ and rewrite the expression as $f(y) = 9y + \frac{4}{y}$, similar to the previous solution. To minimize $f(y)$, take the derivative of $f(y)$ and set it equal to zero.

The derivative of $f(y)$, using the Power Rule, is

$f'(y)$ = $9 - 4y^{-2}$

$f'(y)$ is zero only when $y = \frac{2}{3}$ or $y = -\frac{2}{3}$. It can further be verified that $\frac{2}{3}$ and $-\frac{2}{3}$ are relative minima by finding the derivatives of other points near the critical points. However, since $x \sin{x}$ is always positive in the given domain, $y = \frac{2}{3}$. Therefore, $x\sin{x}$ = $\frac{2}{3}$, and the answer is $\frac{(9)(\frac{2}{3})^2 + 4}{\frac{2}{3}} = \boxed{012}$.


## 1983 AIME Problem 10

The numbers $1447$, $1005$, and $1231$ have something in common. Each is a four-digit number beginning with $1$ that has exactly two identical digits. How many such numbers are there?
Solution

Suppose the two identical digits are both one. Since the thousands digits must be one, the other one can be in only one of three digits,
$11xy,\qquad 1x1y,\qquad1xy1$

Because the number must have exactly two identical digits, $x\neq y$, $x\neq1$, and $y\neq1$. Hence, there are $3\cdot9\cdot8=216$ numbers of this form.

Suppose the two identical digits are not one. Therefore, consider the following possibilities,
$1xxy,\qquad1xyx,\qquad1yxx.$

Again, $x\neq y$, $x\neq 1$, and $y\neq 1$. There are $3\cdot9\cdot8=216$ numbers of this form.

Thus, the desired answer is $216+216=\boxed{432}$.


## 1983 AIME Problem 11
The solid shown has a square base of side length $s$. The upper edge is parallel to the base and has length $2s$. All other edges have length $s$. Given that $s=6\sqrt{2}$, what is the volume of the solid?


<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/5/6/8/5680a5bb8ba2d309d945d72d71950880a221cd5f.png" height="150px" /></div>

Solution
Solution 1

First, we find the height of the figure by drawing a perpendicular from the midpoint of $AD$ to $EF$. The hypotenuse of the triangle is the median of equilateral triangle $ADE$, and one of the legs is $3\sqrt{2}$. We apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find that the height is equal to $6$.

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/a/0/4/a0406c7f42ae451f7ee423c91bd5b18d4cd6b556.png" height="150px" /></div>

Next, we complete the figure into a triangular prism, and find the volume, which is $\frac{6\sqrt{2}\cdot 12\sqrt{2}\cdot 6}{2}=432$.

Now, we subtract off the two extra pyramids that we included, whose combined volume is $2\cdot \left( \frac{6\sqrt{2}\cdot 3\sqrt{2} \cdot 6}{3} \right)=144$.

Thus, our answer is $432-144=\boxed{288}$.
Solution 2

Extend $EA$ and $FB$ to meet at $G$, and $ED$ and $FC$ to meet at $H$. Now, we have a regular tetrahedron $EFGH$, which has twice the volume of our original solid. This tetrahedron has side length $2s = 12\sqrt{2}$. Using the formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron, which is $V = \frac{\sqrt{2}S^3}{12}$, where S is the side length of the tetrahedron, the volume of our original solid is:

$V = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot (12\sqrt{2})^3}{12} = \boxed{288}$


## 1983 AIME Problem 12

The length of diameter $AB$ is a two digit integer. Reversing the digits gives the length of a perpendicular chord $CD$. The distance from their intersection point $H$ to the center $O$ is a positive rational number. Determine the length of $AB$.

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/e/2/a/e2a025fea53e039bbc5201657cdb7117f149ff76.png" height="150px" /></div>

Solution

Let $AB=10x+y$ and $CD=10y+x$. It follows that $CO=\frac{AB}{2}=\frac{10x+y}{2}$ and $CH=\frac{CD}{2}=\frac{10y+x}{2}$. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem on $CO$ and $CH$, $OH=\sqrt{\left(\frac{10x+y}{2}\right)^2-\left(\frac{10y+x}{2}\right)^2}$ $=\sqrt{\frac{9}{4}\cdot 11(x+y)(x-y)}$ $=\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{11(x+y)(x-y)}$.

Because $OH$ is a positive rational number, the quantity $\sqrt{11(x+y)(x-y)}$ cannot contain any square roots. Either $x-y$ or $x+y$ must be 11. However, $x-y$ cannot be 11, because both must be digits. Therefore, $x+y$ must equal eleven and $x-y$ must be a perfect square (since $x+y>x-y$). The only pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies this condition is $(6,5)$, so our answer is $\boxed{065}$.


## 1983 AIME Problem 13
For $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, n\}$ and each of its non-empty subsets, an alternating sum is defined as follows. Arrange the number in the subset in decreasing order and then, beginning with the largest, alternately add and subtract successive numbers. For example, the alternating sum for $\{1, 2, 4, 6,9\}$ is $9-6+4-2+1=6$ and for $\{5\}$ it is simply $5$. Find the sum of all such alternating sums for $n=7$.
Solution 1

Let $S$ be a non- empty subset of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.

Then the alternating sum of $S$ plus the alternating sum of $S$ with 7 included is 7. In mathematical terms, $S+ (S\cup 7)=7$. This is true because when we take an alternating sum, each term of $S$ has the opposite sign of each corresponding term of $S\cup 7$.

Because there are $63$ of these pairs, the sum of all possible subsets of our given set is $63*7$. However, we forgot to include the subset that only contains $7$, so our answer is $64\cdot 7=\boxed{448}$.
Solution 2

Consider a given subset $T$ of $S$ that contains 7; then there is a subset $T'$ which contains all the elements of $T$ except for 7, and only those. Since each element of $T'$ has one element fewer preceding it than it does in $T$, their signs are opposite; so the sum of the alternating sums of $T$ and $T'$ is equal to 7. There are $2^6$ subsets containing 7, so our answer is $7 * 2^6 = \boxed{448}$.


## 1983 AIME Problem 14

In the adjoining figure, two circles with radii $8$ and $6$ are drawn with their centers $12$ units apart. At $P$, one of the points of intersection, a line is drawn in such a way that the chords $QP$ and $PR$ have equal length. Find the square of the length of $QP$.

First, notice that if we reflect $R$ over $P$ we get $Q$. Since we know that $R$ is on circle $B$ and $Q$ is on circle $A$, we can reflect circle $B$ over $P$ to get another circle (centered at a new point $C$ with radius $6$) that intersects circle $A$ at $Q$. The rest is just finding lengths:

Since $P$ is the midpoint of segment $BC$, $AP$ is a median of triangle $ABC$. Because we know that $AB=12$, $BP=PC=6$, and $AP=8$, we can find the third side of the triangle using Stewart's Theorem or similar approaches. We get $AC = \sqrt{56}$. So now we have a kite $AQCP$ with $AQ=AP=8$, $CQ=CP=6$, and $AC=\sqrt{56}$, and all we need is the length of the other diagonal $PQ$. The easiest way it can be found is with the Pythagorean Theorem. Let $2x$ be the length of $PQ$. Then
$\sqrt{36-x^2} + \sqrt{64-x^2} = \sqrt{56}.$

Doing routine algebra on the above equation, we find that $x^2=\frac{65}{2}$, so $PQ^2 = 4x^2 = \boxed{130}.$

Draw additional lines as indicated. Note that since triangles $AQP$ and $BPR$ are isosceles, the altitudes are also bisectors, so let $QM=MP=PN=NR=x$.

Since $\frac{AR}{MR}=\frac{BR}{NR},$ triangles $BNR$ and $AMR$ are similar. If we let $y=BN$, we have $AM=3BN=3y$.

Applying the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $BNR$, we have $x^2+y^2=36$. Similarly, for triangle $QMA$, we have $x^2+9y^2=64$.

Subtracting, $8y^2=28\Rightarrow y^2=\frac72\Rightarrow x^2=\frac{65}2\Rightarrow QP^2=4x^2=\boxed{130}$.
Solution 3
Let $QP=PR=x$. Angles $QPA$, $APB$, and $BPR$ must add up to $180^{\circ}$. By the Law of Cosines, $\angle APB=\cos^{-1}(-11/24)$. Also, angles $QPA$ and $BPR$ equal $\cos^{-1}(x/16)$ and $\cos^{-1}(x/12)$. So we have
$\cos^{-1}(x/16)+\cos^{-1}(-11/24)=180-\cos^{-1}(x/12).$
Taking the $\cos$ of both sides and simplifying using the cosine addition identity gives $x^2=130$.


## 1983 AIME Problem 15
The adjoining figure shows two intersecting chords in a circle, with $B$ on minor arc $AD$. Suppose that the radius of the circle is $5$, that $BC=6$, and that $AD$ is bisected by $BC$. Suppose further that $AD$ is the only chord starting at $A$ which is bisected by $BC$. It follows that the sine of the minor arc $AB$ is a rational number. If this fraction is expressed as a fraction $\frac{m}{n}$ in lowest terms, what is the product $mn$?

Let $A$ be any fixed point on circle $O$ and let $AD$ be a chord of circle $O$. The locus of midpoints $N$ of the chord $AD$ is a circle $P$, with diameter $AO$. Generally, the circle $P$ can intersect the chord $BC$ at two points, one point, or they may not have a point of intersection. By the problem condition, however, the circle $P$ is tangent to BC at point N.

Let M be the midpoint of the chord $BC$. From right triangle $OMB$, $OM = \sqrt{OB^2 - BM^2} =4$. Thus, $\tan \angle BOM = \frac{BM}{OM} = \frac 3 4$.

Notice that the distance $OM$ equals $PN + PO \cos AOM = r(1 + \cos AOM)$ (Where $r$ is the radius of circle P). Evaluating this, $\cos \angle AOM = \frac{OM}{r} - 1 = \frac{2OM}{R} - 1 = \frac 8 5 - 1 = \frac 3 5$. From $\cos \angle AOM$, we see that $\tan \angle AOM =\frac{\sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \angle AOM}}{\cos \angle AOM} = \frac{\sqrt{5^2 - 3^2}}{3} = \frac 4 3$

Next, notice that $\angle AOB = \angle AOM - \angle BOM$. We can therefore apply the tangent subtraction formula to obtain , $\tan AOB =\frac{\tan AOM - \tan BOM}{1 + \tan AOM \cdot \tan AOM} =\frac{\frac 4 3 - \frac 3 4}{1 + \frac 4 3 \cdot \frac 3 4} = \frac{7}{24}$. It follows that $\sin AOB =\frac{7}{\sqrt{7^2+24^2}} = \frac{7}{25}$, resulting in an answer of $7 \cdot 25=\boxed{175}$.
Motivation Behind Solution 1

The above solution works, but is quite messy and somewhat difficult to follow. This solution provides the motivation behind the solution.

First of all, where did the statement "$AD$ is the only chord starting at $A$ and bisected by $BC$ " come from? What is its significance in this problem? What is the criterion for this statement to be true?

We consider the locus of midpoints of the chords from $A$. It is well known that this is the circle with diameter $AO$, where $O$ is the center of the circle. The proof is simple: every midpoint of a chord is a dilation of the endpoint with ratio $1/2$ with center $A$. Thus, the locus is the result of the dilation with ratio $1/2$ of circle $O$ with center $A$. Let the center of this circle be $P$.

Aha! Now we see. $AD$ is bisected by $BC$ if they cross at some point $N$ on the circle. Moreover, since $AD$ is the only chord, $BC$ must be tangent to the circle $P$.

The rest of this problem is straight forward.

Our goal is to find $\sin AOB = \sin (AOM - BOM)$ where $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$. Then we have $BM=3$ and $OM=4$. Let $R$ be the projection of $A$ onto $OM$, and similarly $Q$ be the projection of $P$ onto $OM$. Then it remains to find $AR$ so we can use the sine addition formula.

As $PN$ is a radius of circle $P$, $PN=2.5$, and similarly, $PO=2.5$. Since $OM=4$, $OQ=OM-QM=OM-PN=4-2.5=1.5$. Thus, $PQ=\sqrt{(2.5)^2-1.5^2}=2$.

From here, we see that $\triangle OAR$ is a dilation of $\triangle OPQ$ about center $O$ with ratio $2$, so $AR=2PQ=4$.

Lastly, we apply the formula: $\sin (AOM - BOM) = \sin AOM \cos BOM - \sin BOM \cos AOM = (4/5)(4/5)-(3/5)(3/5)=7/25.$

Thus, our answer is $7\cdot25=\boxed{175}$.
Solution 2 (with the help of coordinates)

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/thumb/b/b7/Aime1983p15s2.png/500px-Aime1983p15s2.png" height="150px" /></div>

Let the circle be $x^2 + y^2 = 25$, and its center be labeled $O=(0,0)$. Since BC=6, we can calculate (by the Pythagorean Theorem) that the distance from $O$ to the line $BD$ is $4$. So we can let $B=(3,4)$ and $C=(-3,4)$. Now assume that $A$ is any point on the major arc BC, and $D$ any point on the minor arc BC. We may let $A=(5 \cos \alpha, 5 \sin \alpha)$, where $\alpha$ is the angle measured from the positive $x$ axis to the ray $OA$. It will also be convenient to define $\alpha_0$ as the measure of angle XOB.

Firstly, since B must lie in the minor arc AD, we see that $\alpha \in \left(-\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha_0,\alpha_0\right)$. However, since the midpoint of AD must lie on BC, and the highest $y$ coordinate of $D$ is $5$, we see that the $y$ coordinate can't be lower than $3$, that is, $\alpha \in \left[\sin^{-1}\frac{3}{5},\alpha_0\right)$.

Secondly, there is a theorem that says that, in a circle, if a chord is bisected by a radius, then the they must be perpendicular. Therefore, suppose that $P$ is the intersection between $AD$ and $BC$, then $OP$ is perpendicular to $AD$. So, if $AD$ is the only chord starting at $A$ which is bisected by $BC$, it means that $P$ is the only point on the chord $BC$ such that $OP$ is perpendicular to $AD$. Now we are ready to make it an algebraic problem. Suppose $P=(p,4)$, $p \in (-3,3)$. The statement $OP$ is perpendicular to $AD$ is equivalent to the following equation:

$-1 = (slope OP)(slope AP)$ $-1 = \frac{4}{p} \cdot \frac{5\sin \alpha - 4}{5\cos \alpha - p}$

It rearranges to the following:

$p^2 - (5\cos \alpha)p + 16 - 20 \sin \alpha = 0$

Given that this equation has only one real root $p\in (-3,3)$, we study the following function:

$f(x) = x^2 - (5\cos \alpha)x + 16 - 20 \sin \alpha$

First, by the fact that $f(x)$ has real solution, it is good to look at its discriminant: must be non-negative:

$\Delta = (5\cos \alpha)^2 - 4(16-20\sin \alpha)$ $= 25 (1- \sin^2 \alpha) - 64 + 80 \sin \alpha$ $= -25 \sin^2 \alpha + 80\sin \alpha - 39$ $= (13 - 5\sin \alpha)(5\sin \alpha - 3)$

It is obvious that this is non-negative. If it is actually zero, then $\sin \alpha = \frac{3}{5}$, and $\cos \alpha = \frac{4}{5}$. In this case, $p = (5\cos \alpha)/2 = 2 \in (-3,3)$. We found a possible case. So we calculate $\sin(arc AB) = \sin (\alpha_0 - \alpha) = \frac{4}{5}\cdot \frac{4}{5} - \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{5} = \frac{7}{25}$.
Note to Solution 2

Note: As an AIME problem, it is already done since we have found one possible case. However, it takes one more step to complete it if we need to say that this is the unique possibility, without appealing to the AIME Uniqueness Principle.

Suppose that $\Delta > 0$, which means that there can be two real roots of $f(x)$, one lying in the interval $(-3,3)$, but another falling out of it. We also see that the average of the two root is $(5\cos \alpha) / 2$, which is a quantity greater than 0, so the root outside of $(-3,3)$ must be no less than 3. Spectating the parabolic curve of $f(x)$, which is a "U shaped" curve hitting the interval $(-3,3)$ once and $[3,\infty)$ another time, it is evident that $f(-3) > 0$ and $f(3)\leq 0$. We can just work on the second one:

$0 \geq f(3) = 25 - 15\cos \alpha - 20 \sin \alpha$ $3\cos \alpha + 4 \sin \alpha \geq 5$

The only way to satisfy this equation is when $A=B$ (by working on Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, or just plotting the line $3x+4y=5$ to see that point $A$ can't go above this line), which does not make sense from the description of the problem. It means that the point $A$ lies in the half plane above the line $3x+4y=5$, inclusive, and the half plane below the line $-3x+4y=5$, exclusive. It is obviously impossible, by drawing the lines and see that the intersection of the two half planes does not share any point with the circle.

## 1994 AIME Problem 1

The increasing sequence $3, 15, 24, 48, \ldots\,$ consists of those positive multiples of 3 that are one less than a perfect square. What is the remainder when the 1994th term of the sequence is divided by 1000?
Solution

One less than a perfect square can be represented by $n^2 - 1 = (n+1)(n-1)$. Either $n+1$ or $n-1$ must be divisible by 3. This is true when $n \equiv -1,\ 1 \equiv 2,\ 1 \mod{3}$. Since 1994 is even, $n$ must $\equiv 1 \mod{3}$. It will be the $\frac{1994}{2} = 997$th such term, so $n = 4 + (997-1) \cdot 3 = 2992$. The value of $n^2 - 1 = 2992^2 - 1 \mod{1000}$ is $063$.


## 1994 AIME Problem 2

A circle with diameter $\overline{PQ}$ of length 10 is internally tangent at $P$ to a circle of radius 20. Square $ABCD$ is constructed with $A$ and $B$ on the larger circle, $\overline{CD}$ tangent at $Q$ to the smaller circle, and the smaller circle outside $ABCD$. The length of $\overline{AB}$ can be written in the form $m + \sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers. Find $m + n$.

Solution

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/6/60/1994_AIME_Problem_2_-_Solution.png" height="150px" /></div>

Call the center of the larger circle $O$. Extend the diameter $\overline{PQ}$ to the other side of the square (at point $E$), and draw $\overline{AO}$. We now have a right triangle, with hypotenuse of length $20$. Since $OQ = OP - PQ = 20 - 10 = 10$, we know that $OE = AB - OQ = AB - 10$. The other leg, $AE$, is just $\frac 12 AB$.

Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:

$(AB - 10)^2 + \left(\frac 12 AB\right)^2 = 20^2$
$AB^2 - 20 AB + 100 + \frac 14 AB^2 - 400 = 0$
$AB^2 - 16 AB - 240 = 0$

The quadratic formula shows that the answer is $\frac{16 \pm \sqrt{16^2 + 4 \cdot 240}}{2} = 8 \pm \sqrt{304}$. Discard the negative root, so our answer is $8 + 304 = 312$.


## 1994 AIME Problem 3


The function $f_{}^{}$ has the property that, for each real number $x,\,$
$f(x)+f(x-1) = x^2\,$
.

If $f(19)=94,\,$ what is the remainder when $f(94)\,$ is divided by $1000$?
Solution 1

$\begin{align*}f(94)&=94^2-f(93)=94^2-93^2+f(92)=94^2-93^2+92^2-f(91)=\cdots \\ &= (94^2-93^2) + (92^2-91^2) +\cdots+ (22^2-21^2)+ 20^2-f(19) \\ &= 94+93+\cdots+21+400-94 \\ &= 4561 \end{align*}$

So, the remainder is $\boxed{561}$.
Solution 2

Those familiar with triangular numbers and some of their properties will quickly recognize the equation given in the problem. It is well-known (and easy to show) that the sum of two consecutive triangular numbers is a perfect square; that is, $T_{n-1} + T_n = n^2,$ where $T_n = 1+2+...+n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is the $n$th triangular number.

Using this, as well as using the fact that the value of $f(x)$ directly determines the value of $f(x+1)$ and $f(x-1),$ we conclude that $f(n) = T_n + K$ for all odd $n$ and $f(n) = T_n - K$ for all even $n,$ where $K$ is a constant real number.

Since $f(19) = 94$ and $T_{19} = 190,$ we see that $K = -96.$ It follows that $f(94) = T_{94} - (-96) = \frac{94\cdot 95}{2} + 96 = 4561,$ so the answer is $561.$


## 1994 AIME Problem 4

Find the positive integer $n\,$ for which $\lfloor\log_2{1}\rfloor+\lfloor\log_2{2}\rfloor+\lfloor\log_2{3}\rfloor+\cdots+\lfloor\log_2{n}\rfloor=1994$ (For real $x\,$, $\lfloor x\rfloor\,$ is the greatest integer $\le x.\,$)
Solution

Note that if $2^x \le a<2^{x+1}$ for some $x\in\mathbb{Z}$, then $\lfloor\log_2{a}\rfloor=\log_2{2^{x}}=x$.

Thus, there are $2^{x+1}-2^{x}=2^{x}$ integers $a$ such that $\lfloor\log_2{a}\rfloor=x$. So the sum of $\lfloor\log_2{a}\rfloor$ for all such $a$ is $x\cdot2^x$.

Let $k$ be the integer such that $2^k \le n<2^{k+1}$. So for each integer $j<k$, there are $2^j$ integers $a\le n$ such that $\lfloor\log_2{a}\rfloor=j$, and there are $n-2^k+1$ such integers such that $\lfloor\log_2{a}\rfloor=k$.

Therefore, $\lfloor\log_2{1}\rfloor+\lfloor\log_2{2}\rfloor+\lfloor\log_2{3}\rfloor+\cdots+\lfloor\log_2{n}\rfloor= \sum_{j=0}^{k-1}(j\cdot2^j) + k(n-2^k+1) = 1994$.

Through computation: $\sum_{j=0}^{7}(j\cdot2^j)=1538<1994$ and $\sum_{j=0}^{8}(j\cdot2^j)=3586>1994$. Thus, $k=8$.

So, $\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}(j\cdot2^j) + k(n-2^k+1) = 1538+8(n-2^8+1)=1994 \Rightarrow n = \boxed{312}$.


## 1994 AIME Problem 5

Given a positive integer $n\,$, let $p(n)\,$ be the product of the non-zero digits of $n\,$. (If $n\,$ has only one digits, then $p(n)\,$ is equal to that digit.) Let
$S=p(1)+p(2)+p(3)+\cdots+p(999)$
.

What is the largest prime factor of $S\,$?

Solution
Solution 1

Suppose we write each number in the form of a three-digit number (so $5 \equiv 005$), and since our $p(n)$ ignores all of the zero-digits, replace all of the $0$s with $1$s. Now note that in the expansion of
$(1+ 1 +2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9) (1+ 1 +2+3+\cdots+9) (1+ 1 +2+3+\cdots+9)$

we cover every permutation of every product of $3$ digits, including the case where that first $1$ represents the replaced $0$s. However, since our list does not include $000$, we have to subtract $1$. Thus, our answer is the largest prime factor of $(1+1+2+3+\cdots +9)^3 - 1 = 46^3 - 1 = (46-1)(46^2 + 46 + 1) = 3^3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot \boxed{103}$.
Solution 2

Note that $p(1)=p(11), p(2)=p(12), p(3)=p(13), \cdots p(19)=p(9)$, and $p(37)=3p(7)$. So $p(10)+p(11)+p(12)+\cdots +p(19)=46$, $p(10)+p(11)+\cdots +p(99)=46*45=2070$. We add $p(1)+p(2)+p(3)+\cdots +p(10)=45$ to get 2115. When we add a digit we multiply the sum by that digit. Thus $2115\cdot (1+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9)=2115\cdot 46=47\cdot 45\cdot 46$. But we didn't count 100, 200, 300, ..., 900. We add another 45 to get $45\cdot 2163$. The largest prime factor of that is $\boxed{103}$.


## 1994 AIME Problem 6


The graphs of the equations
$y=k, \qquad y=\sqrt{3}x+2k, \qquad y=-\sqrt{3}x+2k,$

are drawn in the coordinate plane for $k=-10,-9,-8,\ldots,9,10.\,$ These 63 lines cut part of the plane into equilateral triangles of side $2/\sqrt{3}.\,$ How many such triangles are formed?
Solution
Solution 1

We note that the lines partition the hexagon of the six extremal lines into disjoint unit regular triangles, and forms a series of unit regular triangles along the edge of the hexagon.

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/9/3/f93aa9a41e77a836e8c10cc309749178ef6c5868.png" height="200px" /></div>

Solving the above equations for $k=\pm 10$, we see that the hexagon in question is regular, with side length $\frac{20}{\sqrt{3}}$. Then, the number of triangles within the hexagon is simply the ratio of the area of the hexagon to the area of a regular triangle. Since the ratio of the area of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their side lengths, we see that the ratio of the area of one of the six equilateral triangles composing the regular hexagon to the area of a unit regular triangle is just $\left(\frac{20/\sqrt{3}}{2/\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = 100$. Thus, the total number of unit triangles is $6 \times 100 = 600$.

There are $6 \cdot 10$ equilateral triangles formed by lines on the edges of the hexagon. Thus, our answer is $600+60 = \boxed{660}$.
Solution 2

There are three types of lines: horizontal, upward-slanting diagonal, and downward-slanting diagonal. There are $21$ of each type of line, and a unit equilateral triangle is determined by exactly one of each type of line. Given an upward-slanting diagonal and a downward-slanting diagonal, they determine exactly two unit equilateral triangles as shown below. 

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/4/b/24bc8e24293ee90f2294deb2e879f0164feed207.png" height="150px" /></div>

Therefore, if all horizontal lines are drawn, there will be a total of $2\cdot 21^2=882$ unit equilateral triangles. Of course, we only draw $21$ horizontal lines, so we are overcounting the triangles that are caused by the undrawn horizontal lines. In the below diagram, we draw the diagonal lines and the highest and lowest horizontal lines. 

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/4/e/c/4ece10ed6c17f2fff90d2fbdd0cf682aa8bfc000.png" height="200px" /></div>

We see that the lines $y=-21,-20,\dots, -11$ and $y=11,12,\dots,21$ would complete several of the $882$ unit equilateral triangles. In fact, we can see that the lines $y=-21,-20,\dots,-11$ complete $1,2,(1+3),(2+4),(3+5),(4+6),\dots,(9+11)$ triangles, or $111$ triangles. The positive horizontal lines complete the same number of triangles, hence the answer is $882-2\cdot 111=\boxed{660}$.


## 1994 AIME Problem 7

For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
$ax+by=1\,$
$x^2+y^2=50\,$

has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?
Solution

$x^2+y^2=50$ is the equation of a circle of radius $\sqrt{50}$, centered at the origin. The lattice points on this circle are $(\pm1,\pm7)$, $(\pm5,\pm5)$, and $(\pm7,\pm1)$.

$ax+by=1$ is the equation of a line that does not pass through the origin. (Since $(x,y)=(0,0)$ yields $a(0)+b(0)=0 \neq 1$).

So, we are looking for the number of lines which pass through either one or two of the $12$ lattice points on the circle, but do not pass through the origin.

It is clear that if a line passes through two opposite points, then it passes through the origin, and if a line passes through two non-opposite points, the it does not pass through the origin.

There are $\binom{12}{2}=66$ ways to pick two distinct lattice points, and thus $66$ distinct lines which pass through two lattice points on the circle. However, $\frac{12}{2}=6$ of these lines pass through the origin.

Since there is a unique tangent line to the circle at each of these lattice points, there are $12$ distinct lines which pass through exactly one lattice point on the circle.

Thus, there are a total of $66-6+12=\boxed{072}$ distinct lines which pass through either one or two of the $12$ lattice points on the circle, but do not pass through the origin.

## 1994 AIME Problem 8

The points $(0,0)\,$, $(a,11)\,$, and $(b,37)\,$ are the vertices of an equilateral triangle. Find the value of $ab\,$.
Solution

Consider the points on the complex plane. The point $b+37i$ is then a rotation of $60$ degrees of $a+11i$ about the origin, so:

$(a+11i)\left(\text{cis}\,60^{\circ}\right) = (a+11i)\left(\frac 12+\frac{\sqrt{3}i}2\right)=b+37i.$

Equating the real and imaginary parts, we have:

$\begin{align*}b&=\frac{a}{2}-\frac{11\sqrt{3}}{2}\\37&=\frac{11}{2}+\frac{a\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{align*}$

Solving this system, we find that $a=21\sqrt{3}, b=5\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{315}$.

Note: There is another solution where the point $b+37i$ is a rotation of $-60$ degrees of $a+11i$; however, this triangle is just a reflection of the first triangle by the $y$-axis, and the signs of $a$ and $b$ are flipped. However, the product $ab$ is unchanged.

## 1994 AIME Problem 9

A solitaire game is played as follows. Six distinct pairs of matched tiles are placed in a bag. The player randomly draws tiles one at a time from the bag and retains them, except that matching tiles are put aside as soon as they appear in the player's hand. The game ends if the player ever holds three tiles, no two of which match; otherwise the drawing continues until the bag is empty. The probability that the bag will be emptied is $p/q,\,$ where $p\,$ and $q\,$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q.\,$
Solution

Let $P_k$ be the probability of emptying the bag when it has $k$ pairs in it. Let's consider the possible draws for the first three cards:

Case 1. We draw a pair on the first two cards. The second card is the same as the first with probability $\frac {1}{2k - 1}$, then we have $k - 1$ pairs left. So this contributes probability $\frac {P_{k - 1}}{2k - 1}$.

Case 2. We draw a pair on the first and third cards. The second card is different from the first with probability $\frac {2k - 2}{2k - 1}$ and the third is the same as the first with probability $\frac {1}{2k - 2}$. We are left with $k - 1$ pairs but one card already drawn. However, having drawn one card doesn't affect the game, so this also contributes probability $\frac {P_{k - 1}}{2k - 1}$.

Case 3. We draw a pair on the second and third cards. This is pretty much the same as case 2, so we get $\frac {P_{k - 1}}{2k - 1}$. 

Therefore, we obtain the recursion $P_k = \frac {3}{2k - 1}P_{k - 1}$. Iterating this for $k = 6,5,4,3,2$ (obviously $P_1 = 1$), we get $\frac {3^5}{11*9*7*5*3} = \frac {9}{385}$, and $p+q=\boxed{394}$. 

## 1994 AIME Problem 10

In triangle $ABC,$ angle $C$ is a right angle and the altitude from $C$ meets $\overline{AB}$ at $D.$ The lengths of the sides of $\triangle ABC$ are integers, $BD=29^3,$ and $\cos B=m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$
Solution

Since $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle CBD$, we have $\frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{29^3}{BC} \Longrightarrow BC^2 = 29^3 AB$. It follows that $29^2 | BC$ and $29 | AB$, so $BC$ and $AB$ are in the form $29^2 a$ and $29 a^2$, respectively.

By the Pythagorean Theorem, we find that $AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2 \Longrightarrow (29^2a)^2 + AC^2 = (29 a^2)^2$, so $29a | AC$. Letting $b = AC / 29a$, we obtain after dividing through by $(29a)^2$, $29^2 = a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$. As $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$, the pairs of factors of $29^2$ are $(1,29^2)(29,29)$; clearly $b = \frac{AC}{29a} \neq 0$, so $a-b = 1, a+b= 29^2$. Then, $a = \frac{1+29^2}{2} = 421$.

Thus, $\cos B = \frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{29^2 a}{29a^2} = \frac{29}{421}$, and $m+n = \boxed{450}$. 

## 1994 AIME Problem 11


Ninety-four bricks, each measuring $4''\times10''\times19'',$ are to stacked one on top of another to form a tower 94 bricks tall. Each brick can be oriented so it contribues $4''\,$ or $10''\,$ or $19''\,$ to the total height of the tower. How many different tower heights can be achieved using all ninety-four of the bricks?
Solution
Solution 1

We have the smallest stack, which has a height of $94 \times 4$ inches. Now when we change the height of one of the bricks, we either add $0$ inches, $6$ inches, or $15$ inches to the height. Now all we need to do is to find the different change values we can get from $94$ $0$'s, $6$'s, and $15$'s. Because $0$, $6$, and $15$ are all multiples of $3$, the change will always be a multiple of $3$, so we just need to find the number of changes we can get from $0$'s, $2$'s, and $5$'s.

From here, we count what we can get:

$0, 2 = 2, 4 = 2+2, 5 = 5, 6 = 2+2+2, 7 = 5+2, 8 = 2+2+2+2, 9 = 5+2+2, \ldots$

It seems we can get every integer greater or equal to four; we can easily deduce this by considering parity or using the Chicken McNugget Theorem, which says that the greatest number that cannot be expressed in the form of $2m + 5n$ for $m,n$ being positive integers is $5 \times 2 - 5 - 2=3$.

But we also have a maximum change ($94 \times 5$), so that will have to stop somewhere. To find the gaps, we can work backwards as well. From the maximum change, we can subtract either $0$'s, $3$'s, or $5$'s. The maximum we can't get is $5 \times 3-5-3=7$, so the numbers $94 \times 5-8$ and below, except $3$ and $1$, work. Now there might be ones that we haven't counted yet, so we check all numbers between $94 \times 5-8$ and $94 \times 5$. $94 \times 5-7$ obviously doesn't work, $94 \times 5-6$ does since 6 is a multiple of 3, $94 \times 5-5$ does because it is a multiple of $5$ (and $3$), $94 \times 5-4$ doesn't since $4$ is not divisible by $5$ or $3$, $94 \times 5-3$ does since $3=3$, and $94 \times 5-2$ and $94 \times 5-1$ don't, and $94 \times 5$ does.

Thus the numbers $0$, $2$, $4$ all the way to $94 \times 5-8$, $94 \times 5-6$, $94 \times 5-5$, $94 \times 5-3$, and $94\times 5$ work. That's $2+(94 \times 5 - 8 - 4 +1)+4=\boxed{465}$ numbers. That's the number of changes you can make to a stack of bricks with dimensions $4 \times 10 \times 14$, including not changing it at all.
Solution 2

Using bricks of dimensions $4''\times10''\times19''$ is comparable to using bricks of dimensions $0''\times6''\times15''$ which is comparable to using bricks of dimensions $0''\times2''\times5''$. Using 5 bricks of height $2''$ can be replaced by using 2 bricks of height $5''$ and 3 bricks of height $0''$.

It follows that all tower heights can be made by using 4 or fewer bricks of height $2''$. There are $95+94+93+92+91=465$ ways to build a tower using 4 or fewer bricks of height $2''$. Taking the heights $\mod 5$, we see that towers using a different number of bricks of height $2''$ have unequal heights. Thus, all of the $\boxed{465}$ tower heights are different.


## 1994 AIME Problem 12

A fenced, rectangular field measures $24$ meters by $52$ meters. An agricultural researcher has 1994 meters of fence that can be used for internal fencing to partition the field into congruent, square test plots. The entire field must be partitioned, and the sides of the squares must be parallel to the edges of the field. What is the largest number of square test plots into which the field can be partitioned using all or some of the 1994 meters of fence?
Solution

Suppose there are $n$ squares in every column of the grid, so there are $\frac{52}{24}n = \frac {13}6n$ squares in every row. Then $6|n$, and our goal is to maximize the value of $n$.

Each vertical fence has length $24$, and there are $\frac{13}{6}n - 1$ vertical fences; each horizontal fence has length $52$, and there are $n-1$ such fences. Then the total length of the internal fencing is $24\left(\frac{13n}{6}-1\right) + 52(n-1) = 104n - 76 \le 1994 \Longrightarrow n \le \frac{1035}{52} \approx 19.9$, so $n \le 19$. The largest multiple of $6$ that is $\le 19$ is $n = 18$, which we can easily verify works, and the answer is $\frac{13}{6}n^2 = \boxed{702}$.

## 1994 AIME Problem 13

The equation
$x^{10}+(13x-1)^{10}=0$ has 10 complex roots $r_1, \overline{r_1}, r_2, \overline{r_2}, r_3, \overline{r_3}, r_4, \overline{r_4}, r_5, \overline{r_5},$ where the bar denotes complex conjugation. Find the value of $\frac 1{r_1\overline{r_1}}+\frac 1{r_2\overline{r_2}}+\frac 1{r_3\overline{r_3}}+\frac 1{r_4\overline{r_4}}+\frac 1{r_5\overline{r_5}}.$

Solution 1

Let $t = 1/x$. After multiplying the equation by $t^{10}$, $1 + (13 - t)^{10} = 0\Rightarrow (13 - t)^{10} = - 1$.

Using DeMoivre, $13 - t = \text{cis}\left(\frac {(2k + 1)\pi}{10}\right)$ where $k$ is an integer between $0$ and $9$.

$t = 13 - \text{cis}\left(\frac {(2k + 1)\pi}{10}\right) \Rightarrow \bar{t} = 13 - \text{cis}\left(-\frac {(2k + 1)\pi}{10}\right)$.

Since $\text{cis}(\theta) + \text{cis}(-\theta) = 2\cos(\theta)$, $t\bar{t} = 170 - 26\cos \left(\frac {(2k + 1)\pi}{10}\right)$ after expanding. Here $k$ ranges from 0 to 4 because two angles which sum to $2\pi$ are involved in the product.

The expression to find is $\sum t\bar{t} = 850 - 26\sum_{k = 0}^4 \cos \frac {(2k + 1)\pi}{10}$.

But $\cos \frac {\pi}{10} + \cos \frac {9\pi}{10} = \cos \frac {3\pi}{10} + \cos \frac {7\pi}{10} = \cos \frac {\pi}{2} = 0$ so the sum is $\boxed{850}$.

Solution 2

Divide both sides by $x^{10}$ to get \[1 + \left(13-\dfrac{1}{x}\right)^{10}=0\]

Rearranging:$[\left(13-\dfrac{1}{x}\right)^{10} = -1$

Thus, $13-\dfrac{1}{x} = \omega$ where $\omega = e^{i(\pi n/5+\pi/10)}$ where $n$ is an integer.

We see that $\dfrac{1}{x}=13-\omega$. Thus, $\dfrac{1}{x\overline{x}}=(13-\omega)(13-\overline{\omega})=169-13(\omega+\overline{\omega})+\omega\overline{\omega}=170-13(\omega+\overline{\omega})$

Summing over all terms: $\dfrac{1}{r_1\overline{r_1}}+\cdots + \dfrac{1}{r_5\overline{r_5}} = 5\cdot 170 - 13(e^{i\pi/10}+\cdots +e^{i(9\pi/5+\pi/10)})$

However, note that $e^{i\pi/10}+\cdots +e^{i(9\pi/5+\pi/10)}=0$ from drawing the numbers on the complex plane, our answer is just $5\cdot 170=\boxed{850}$

## 1994 AIME Problem 14

A beam of light strikes $\overline{BC}$ at point $C$ with angle of incidence $\alpha=19.94^\circ$ and reflects with an equal angle of reflection as shown. The light beam continues its path, reflecting off line segments $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{BC}$ according to the rule: angle of incidence equals angle of reflection. Given that $\beta=\alpha/10=1.994^\circ$ and $AB=BC,$ determine the number of times the light beam will bounce off the two line segments. Include the first reflection at $C$ in your count.

<div align=center><img src="http://wiki-images.artofproblemsolving.com/5/5d/AIME_1994_Problem_14.png" height="150px" /></div>

Solution

At each point of reflection, we pretend instead that the light continues to travel straight. 

<div align=center><img src="http://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/e/7/1/e718cb1b4bf8cc233b6061a4715b60c62a4b55ff.png" height="200px" /></div>

Note that after $k$ reflections (excluding the first one at $C$) the extended line will form an angle $k \beta$ at point $B$. For the $k$th reflection to be just inside or at the point $C$, we must have $k\beta \le 180 - 2\alpha \Longrightarrow k \le \frac{180 - 2\alpha}{\beta} = 70.27$. Thus, our answer is, including the first intersection, $\left\lfloor \frac{180 - 2\alpha}{\beta} \right\rfloor + 1 = \boxed{071}$.

Problem

Given a point $P^{}_{}$ on a triangular piece of paper $ABC,\,$ consider the creases that are formed in the paper when $A, B,\,$ and $C\,$ are folded onto $P.\,$ Let us call $P_{}^{}$ a fold point of $\triangle ABC\,$ if these creases, which number three unless $P^{}_{}$ is one of the vertices, do not intersect. Suppose that $AB=36, AC=72,\,$ and $\angle B=90^\circ.\,$ Then the area of the set of all fold points of $\triangle ABC\,$ can be written in the form $q\pi-r\sqrt{s},\,$ where $q, r,\,$ and $s\,$ are positive integers and $s\,$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. What is $q+r+s\,$?
Solution

Let $O_{AB}$ be the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors (in other words, the intersections of the creases) of $\overline{PA}$ and $\overline{PB}$, and so forth. Then $O_{AB}, O_{BC}, O_{CA}$ are, respectively, the circumcenters of $\triangle PAB, PBC, PCA$. According to the problem statement, the circumcenters of the triangles cannot lie within the interior of the respective triangles, since they are not on the paper. It follows that $\angle APB, \angle BPC, \angle CPA > 90^{\circ}$; the locus of each of the respective conditions for $P$ is the region inside the (semi)circles with diameters $\overline{AB}, \overline{BC}, \overline{CA}$.

We note that the circle with diameter $AC$ covers the entire triangle because it is the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$, so it suffices to take the intersection of the circles about $AB, BC$. We note that their intersection lies entirely within $\triangle ABC$ (the chord connecting the endpoints of the region is in fact the altitude of $\triangle ABC$ from $B$). Thus, the area of the locus of $P$ (shaded region below) is simply the sum of two segments of the circles. If we construct the midpoints of $M_1, M_2 = \overline{AB}, \overline{BC}$ and note that $\triangle M_1BM_2 \sim \triangle ABC$, we see that thse segments respectively cut a $120^{\circ}$ arc in the circle with radius $18$ and $60^{\circ}$ arc in the circle with radius $18\sqrt{3}$.

The diagram shows $P$ outside of the grayed locus; notice that the creases [the dotted blue] intersect within the triangle, which is against the problem conditions. The area of the locus is the sum of two segments of two circles; these segments cut out $120^{\circ}, 60^{\circ}$ angles by simple similarity relations and angle-chasing.

Hence, the answer is, using the $\frac 12 ab\sin C$ definition of triangle area, $\left[\frac{\pi}{3} \cdot 18^2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot 18^2 \sin \frac{2\pi}{3} \right] + \left[\frac{\pi}{6} \cdot \left(18\sqrt{3}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot (18\sqrt{3})^2 \sin \frac{\pi}{3}\right] = 270\pi - 324\sqrt{3}$, and $q+r+s = \boxed{597}$.
